		<Description> To investigate genetic variants that affect iron concentrations in persons not affected by overt genetic disorders of iron metabolism, a genome-wide association study was conducted in participants of European descent from the InCHIANTI Study (N=1206) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA, N=713).  Genome-wide data from each study was filtered if they deviated from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (P &#60;0.0001), had low call rate (&#60;99%) or low minor allele frequency (MAF &#60; 1%). The resulting 475,322 autosomal SNPs that passed quality control were used for association analysis.</Description>
