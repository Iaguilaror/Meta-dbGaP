<p>Version 1</p> <p>The aim of this study was to identify gene(s) associated with serum iron concentrations. This dataset contains the results from a meta-analysis of 1919 subjects from the InCHIANTI and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Both studies are population based prospective studies that evaluate the contributors of normal aging.</p> <p>Version 2</p> <p>We performed genome wide analysis of 93 circulating biomarkers in the InCHIANTI study of 1210 individuals, after imputation from the 1000 genomes project.</p>]]>

		<Description> To investigate genetic variants that affect iron concentrations in persons not affected by overt genetic disorders of iron metabolism, a genome-wide association study was conducted in participants of European descent from the InCHIANTI Study (N=1206) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA, N=713).  Genome-wide data from each study was filtered if they deviated from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (P &#60;0.0001), had low call rate (&#60;99%) or low minor allele frequency (MAF &#60; 1%). The resulting 475,322 autosomal SNPs that passed quality control were used for association analysis.</Description>

The purpose of this study is to identify loci associated withcirculating moleules, many of which are known biomarkers of disease.</p> 
<p>In addition, we compare  findings obtained by association analysis based on HapMapimputation with 1000-Genomes imputation to determine whether loci have been missed by previous GWA studies that have analysed variants catalogued only in the HapMap Project.
