	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The NCI GWAS of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in African Americans was undertaken to provide insight into genetic loci affecting susceptibility to this malignancy in a racial group known to be at elevated risk. We genotyped 1,136,723 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 255 cases and 375 controls of African ancestry from the NCI Kidney Cancer Study, and further investigated 16 SNPs in a replication set consisting of 140 cases and 543 controls from a case-control study conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The variant rs10771279 located on 12p11, 77kb from a European-ancestry RCC risk marker, was associated with RCC risk in the GWAS (P=1.2 x 10-7) but did not replicate (P=0.99). The variant 7105934 on 11q13.3, previously associated with RCC in a GWAS using European-ancestry samples, was associated with risk in both studies [meta-analysis odds ratio (OR)=0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.64-0.91; P=0.0022]. The frequency of this allele was higher than that observed in the European-ancestry GWAS (0.56 and 0.07 respectively among controls). The rs7105934 association was stronger for clear cell RCC (ccRCC: OR=0.56; P=7.4 x 10-7) and absent for cases of other or unknown histology (OR=1.02; P=0.86). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that rs7105934 is a susceptibility locus for RCC, and clear-cell RCC in particular, among African Americans.</p>]]>

<p>The NCI Kidney Cancer Study was undertaken between 2002 and 2007 to better understand risk factors for kidney cancer in U.S. black and white populations, and in particular to understand factors affecting the discrepancy in kidney cancer incidence between these racial groups.</p>]]>
