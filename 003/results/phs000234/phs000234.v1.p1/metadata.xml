	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The "Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies" project is collaboration between Group 	Health Cooperative (GH), the University of Washington (UW), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  It is one of 	5 sites participating in The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network funded by the National Human Genome Research 	Institute (NHGRI) with additional funding from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS).  The overall eMERGE 	project is designed to assess whether linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical 	records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies and whether information can 	be pooled across sites.  The primary phenotype in the Group Health/UW Aging and Dementia eMERGE study project is dementia.</p> 	<p>Phenotyped participants originated from four population-based sources.  Seattle-area members of GH (a large integrated health 	care system in Washington State) consented and enrolled in 1) the University of Washington Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Patient 	Registry (ADPR) and 2) the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, 3) Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research 	Project (PMRP), a population-based DNA, plasma and serum biobank of 20,000 adults, 4) Vanderbilt&#39;s BioVU, a de-identified 	DNA biobank.</p> 	<p>The ADPR (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is a population-based registry of incident dementia cases designed to 	identify all new dementia cases within GH from 1987 to 1996.  Potential dementia cases were identified through referrals from 	primary care physicians, mental health services, and neurologists, as well as review of CT scans, neurology, emergency room, 	geriatrician, and mental health clinic logs, and hospital discharge diagnoses.  Medical history, physical, laboratory testing, 	and neuropsychological testing were performed on all consenting potential cases.  These data were reviewed by a consensus 	conference including a neuropsychologist, study physicians, and an epidemiologist.  After discussion of the case, dementia 	status is assigned using DSM-III-R criteria.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease status was assigned using the National Institute of 	Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer&#39;s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) 	criteria.  The study base of the ADPR population was stable with an attrition rate of less than 1%/year.</p> 	<p>The ACT study (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is an ongoing community-based cohort study designed to determine 	the incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (AD), other types of dementia, and cognitive impairment and to determine risk factors 	for these conditions.  The original cohort of 2,581 was enrolled in 1994-1996.  An expansion cohort of 811 was enrolled 	in 2000-2002.  Continuous enrollment to keep 2,000 persons enrolled and at-risk for dementia outcomes was begun in 2005. 	To date the study has accrued more than 4,000 participants.  Dementia-free participants are enrolled in this cohort and 	evaluated every two years by study personnel with many evaluations including an assessment of cognitive functioning 	using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), which is an extended version of the Mini-Mental State 	Examination that has been widely used in epidemiological studies of the elderly.  Persons with CASI scores lower 	than 86 or in whom interviewers suspect unusual cognitive decline are followed up with dementia diagnostic evaluations 	which include physical and neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests.  Medical records are reviewed, and 	laboratory tests and neuroimaging are obtained if not available.  The dementia diagnoses and dementia subtypes are 	determined during a consensus conference attended by the examining clinicians and other study physicians, a neuropsychologist, 	and research nurse.  After discussion of the case, dementia status is assigned using DSM-IV criteria.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease 	status was assigned using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.  Individuals diagnosed with dementia are seen again one year following diagnosis 	using the same procedures.  Individuals not diagnosed with dementia are returned to the pool of at-risk individuals and are 	seen at their next routinely scheduled biennial visit.  The ACT sub-sample is stable; for the original cohort, median 	enrollment in GH was 19 years prior to joining the ACT study, and 85% of the cohort has &#8805; 10 years of GH enrollment.</p> 	<p>DNA for the ADPR participants were obtained through a companion study, Genetic Differences in Cases and Controls 	(PI: Walter Kukull; NIH/NIA R01 AG007584).  DNA obtained through both studies were extracted from blood using Gentra 	Systems Puregene methods.  DNA concentration is determined by UV optical density. All samples are checked for quality 	by OD 260/280 ratio.  For long-term storage, samples are aliquoted and stored at -70&#176;C.</p> 	<p>The Marshfield study, Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP), a population-based DNA, plasma and serum biobank 	of 20,000 adults. PMRP was started in 2002 as a 3 Phase project.  Completed in April 2004, the objectives of Phase I were 	to build and develop a large population-based biobank with DNA, plasma and serum samples to facilitate genomics research. 	Phase 1 was also to educate, inform and consult with the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area population and communities 	concerning potential studies, create the DNA foundation of the personalized medicine database and build the bioinformatics 	tools to store securely and analyze genotypic and phenotypic data. Phase I tasks included operation of the ethics and 	security advisory board, scientific advisory board and community advisory group. More than 18,000 residents aged 18 and 	above from 19 different zip codes surrounding Marshfield, WI were invited to participate in Phase I.  After providing 	written informed consent, participants completed brief questionnaires that included questions about demographics, some 	environmental exposures, family history of disease, and adverse drug reactions, as well as family members living in the 	area.  Participants provided 50ml of blood from which DNA was extracted and plasma and serum samples were stored. The 	informed consent process allowed access to electronic medical records and included language about non-disclosure of personal 	research results.  A tick-off box was included so that participants could either allow or decline subsequent recontact for 	future research studied.  The objectives of Phase II are to create the phenotypic database, establish the scientific and 	administrative infrastructure to support genetic mapping of the DNA and the initial discovery projects and genotype a 	sufficient portion of the genetic material to support these discovery projects. The objectives of Phase III are to expand 	the discovery projects, complete the genotyping of the genetic database and expand physician/health care provider education 	and community consultation.</p> 	<p>The Vanderbilt BioVU model uses discarded blood leftover from clinical care and de-identified clinical information, both 	of which are tracked with a Research Unique Identifier that is permanently disconnected from the medical record number used to 	generate it. The Vanderbilt IRB determined that the project does not qualify as "human subject" research under &#167;46.102(f)(1)(2). 	The program has been reviewed by OHRP twice (the latest immediately prior to launch), and the determination of the Vanderbilt 	IRB that the project is consistent with the 8/10/2004 guidance has been validated.  The model includes a simple opt out mechanism 	developed for patients who do not wish to have their samples included. Planning (including community involvement, ethics and 	IRB discussions, focus groups, development of operating procedures and pilot studies to assess them) began in May 2004, and 	the resource commenced sample collection in February 2007 and as of May 2009 contains approximately 56,000 samples. The current 	resource will be available to all Vanderbilt investigators who sign a Data Use Agreement. The resource represents Vanderbilt&#39;s 	broad patient population and thus provides a potential resource for research in a range of common and rare diseases as well as 	drug response or medication safety.</p> 	<p>BioVU patient protection model: There has been extensive involvement by the ethics community and the IRB to put in place 	procedures to provide privacy protection. The overall protection plan is multifaceted and includes a combination of technology 	and policy: (1) creation of the SD described above; (2) return of only the specific clinical data items requested by 	investigators (rather than the complete de-identified chart); (3) submission of any specific proposed project to the IRB 	and to a separate protocol review committee, both of which must approve; (4) implementing a Data Use Agreement that permits 	only approved queries and data analyses, specifically prohibits attempts at re-identification (at the risk of institutional 	sanctions), and mandates redeposit of all genetic information generated in a research study back into a genomic database; 	and (5) tracking and auditing all use.</p>]]>

<p>Our study includes 257 ADPR participants (all of whom are dementia cases) and 2613 ACT participants (470 dementia cases, 2125 	dementia controls) with viable specimens for genotyping.</p> 	<p><b>Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry (ADPR):</b></p> 	<p>Included Seattle-area members of GH enrollees who were 60 years or older, with symptoms of dementia, and determined to be 	dementia cases.</p> 	<p>Patients were excluded if their physicians felt it was inappropriate for them to be involved the study (for example they 	were too ill), if dementia was diagnosed before January 1, 1987, or they had no memory problems.</p> 	<p><b>Adult Changes in Thought (ACT):</b></p> 	<p>Included a simple random sample of Seattle-area members of Group Health Cooperative enrollees who were 65 years or older and 	had either 1) a baseline Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) of value of at least 86 of 100 or 2) a baseline CASI 	of 80-86 who scored 86 or higher on retesting 2 months later and whose Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the 	Elderly (IQCODE) score was normal, or 3) a baseline CASI less than 80 who on complete diagnostic evaluation did not meet 	clinical criteria for dementia.</p> 	<p>Exclusion criteria included residents of a nursing home, participation in other studies, diagnosis of dementia, or 1) 	scoring 80-86 on the baseline CASI whose score remained low on retesting 2 months later, 2) scoring 80-86 on the baseline CASI 	with acquired cognitive impairment corroborated by the IQCODE and Blessed Dementia Rating Scale or no corroborating information 	available after a complete diagnostic evaluation and a consensus review ruled them ineligible.  Living participants were also 	excluded if they did not provide consent to have their information submitted to dbGaP.</p> 	<p><b>Research Based Case Determination:</b></p> 	<p>In both ADRP and ACT research cohorts, the diagnosis of dementia was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of 	mental disorders (ACT: IV; ADPR: III R) and the diagnosis of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease was based on the National Institute of 	Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer&#39;s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) 	working group criteria.  The dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s Disease research definitions are not applicable to the Marshfield and 	Vanderbilt participants.</p> 	<p><b>EMR Based Case Determination:</b></p> 	<p>For comparability with other eMERGE sites (Vanderbilt (n=272 cases) and Marshfield (n=224 cases)), study investigators also 	determined dementia status using a criterion based entirely on electronic medical records.  The EMR derived definition can not 	be applied to the older GH ADPR cohort.  Applying the automated algorithm to EMR data, dementia was defined as 5 occurrences 	of a dementia related ICD-9 code OR a prescription for a medication used to treat dementia.  ICD-9 codes included Alzheimer&#39;s 	disease (331.0), senile dementia - uncomplicated (290.0), presenile dementia  (290-10-290.13), senile dementia 	delusional [paranoid] features ( 290.20), senile dementia with depressive features ( 290.21), senile dementia with delirium 	or confusion (290.3), arteriosclerotic dementia (290.40-290.43), dementia due to alcohol (291.0-291.2), dementia due to 	drugs (292.82), dementia, unspecified (294.8), dementia not classified as senile, presenile, or arteriosclerotic (294.10-294.11), 	Pick&#39;s disease of the brain (331.11), other frontotemporal dementia (331.19), dementia with Lewy bodies (331.82).  Prescription 	medications included donepezil, Aricept, galantamine, Razadyne, Reminyl, Nivalin, rivastigmine, Exelon, tacrine, Cognex, 	memantine, Namenda, Axura, Ebixa, and Akatinol.</p>]]>
