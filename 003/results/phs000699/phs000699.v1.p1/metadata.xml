	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>In this study we attempt to elucidate the genomic characteristics of osteosarcoma.</p> <p><b>Clinical characteristics</b><br/> 58 tumor / normal pairs from 58 patients were included in the study. Median age at diagnosis was 12 years. 49% of the patients were male and 47% had metastases at diagnosis. 5 year overall survival was 49% for the entire population, 33% for patients with metastatic disease and 64% for patients with localized disease. Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis had a significantly worse overall survival. All cases except 2 were sporadic and no patients had stigmata of Rothmund-Thomson, Bloom&#39;s or Werner&#39;s syndromes or Paget&#39;s disease. Two familial cases were affected siblings from a family in which there were 2 unaffected parents and 2 unaffected siblings. None of the patients had known Li Fraumeni or hereditary retinoblastoma. </p> <p><b>Sample Selection and Clinical Data</b><br/> Samples were contributed by hospitals in Brazil, Spain, Mexico and the United States. All patients had histopathology confirmed to be osteosarcoma by a pathologist at the local institution. All but 5 tumor specimens sequenced were obtained pre-chemotherapy from the primary tumor at the time of diagnosis. 2 tumor specimens were obtained pre-chemotherapy from a metastatic tumor at the time of diagnosis. 3 tumor specimens were obtained post-chemotherapy from a metastatic tumor. </p>]]>

		<Description>The datasets includes osteosarcoma osteosarcoma tumor/normal (blood) sample pairs that were studied by whole-genome sequencing (WGS; 13 cases), whole-exome sequencing (WES; 59 cases), and RNA-Sequencing (RNASeq; 35 cases). Clinical features of the patient population including outcome were typical for osteosarcoma, with the exception of a higher proportion (47%) with metastases at diagnosis. All cases except two were sporadic, and no patients had clinically apparent germline syndromes associated with osteosarcoma.</Description>
