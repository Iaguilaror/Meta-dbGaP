	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Psoriasis, a highly prevalent disease of humans of unknown cause, is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily involving 	skin, with distinctive clinical characteristics. With the newly developed tools that facilitate microbiome research, it now 	is possible to assess whether the cutaneous microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Preliminary data 	from our studies suggest that the cutaneous microbiome in psoriasis is complex and possibly different from normal. To deal 	with this complexity, we propose to examine the cutaneous microbiome in relation to psoriasis with explorations at several 	taxonomic and informatic levels. Our overall objective is to examine how changes in the normal cutaneous microbiome contribute 	to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Since causality is complex and often difficult to prove, and beyond the scope of this RFP, 	our overall hypothesis is that there are alterations in the cutaneous microbiome in areas of skin affected by psoriasis in 	comparison with the range observed in clinically unaffected areas, or in healthy persons. We also hypothesize that the 	characteristics of the microbiome may affect clinical responses to the immunomodulatory agents used to treat psoriasis. 	An alternative hypothesis is that effective treatment of psoriasis with systemic immunomodulatory agents will not substantially 	affect the disordered microbial ecosystem.  Such observations would provide evidence for the roles of the microbiota in this 	disorder. Since an important consideration in microbiome research is the optimal level (e.g. phylum, genus, species, strain, 	gene) at which to examine a scientific question, and we are not yet certain what are the optimal levels for psoriasis, 	this also will be examined. Our studies of psoriasis should allow development of both approaches and tools that will have 	general utility for Microbiome research. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To understand 	the cutaneous microbiome species composition overlaying psoriatic lesions; 2) To investigate differences in metagenome 	content for psoriatic lesions compared to normal skin; 3) To identify differences in the transcriptional profiles of the 	microbiome and the host between normal skin and psoriatic lesions using high-throughput sequencing; and 4. To estimate the 	effects of systemic immunomodulatory therapy for psoriasis on microbiome composition. In total, these studies should help 	us understand the role of the microbiome in psoriasis pathogenesis.     </p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p><b>Psoriasis: clinical features and course.</b> The initial lesions of psoriasis often appear gradually. The natural history 	of psoriasis following initial symptoms includes unpredictable exacerbations and remissions, but no long-lasting freedom from 	disease (1, 2). After the initial presentation, the disease usually consolidates into a chronic condition that sometimes 	varies in intensity depending on season, worsening flares in colder, drier months, and the presence of concomitant infections. 	Specific drugs (lithium, beta-blockers, alcohol, and withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids) may cause exacerbations of 	disease (3). There are different types of psoriasis (2, 4). Chronic plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris [PV]), the most 	common form, is marked by relatively static, thick, erythematous plaques with overlying scale, that may bleed if removed 	(Auspitz sign). Although the plaques of psoriasis can appear anywhere on the skin, including trunk, extremities, genitals, 	and face, the most commonly affected areas are the elbows and knees, lower back, and scalp (5).</p> 	<p>Other forms of psoriasis include <b>pustular psoriasis</b>, an acute generalized eruption of sterile 	pustules that may be accompanied by fever, lymphocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Pustular psoriasis 	may be limited to the hands and fingers or the palms and soles. This form also appears during pregnancy (referred 	to as "impetigo herpetiformis"). <b>Guttate psoriasis</b> is characterized by small psoriatic papules 	and plaques (0.5-1.5 cm) distributed diffusely over the trunk and proximal extremities. Streptococcal pharyngitis often 	precedes guttate psoriasis, which commonly occurs in children and adolescents. <b>Erythrodermic psoriasis</b> is characterized 	by large erythematous patches (involving &gt; 2/3 of the body surface area) without much overlying scale. Both the plaque 	and pustular psoriasis variants may progress to this more severe form of the disease. Psoriasis may be associated with both 	nail disease (onychodystrophy) and arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis involves asymmetrical joints including the vertebral 	and sacroiliac joints. Psoriasis may be related to Reiter&#39;s syndrome, a post-infectious disease constellation characterized 	by urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. The frequency of inflammatory bowel disease is higher in patients with psoriasis, 	and many patients with psoriatic arthritis have asymptomatic bowel inflammation. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes 	mellitus all are more common in psoriatic patients (6).</p> 	<p>The lesions of psoriasis display several primary features: 	(i) <b>keratinocyte hyperplasia</b>, characterized by thickening of the epidermis (acanthosis) and downward expansion of the rete 	pegs, and associated with multiple overlying layers of scale (parakeratosis), and loss of the highest (granular) layer 	of the epidermis; (ii) <b>inflammation</b>, characterized by infiltrating neutrophils within the epidermis and in the scaly layer, 	and lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DC) in the dermis and epidermis; and (iii) <b>ectatic blood vessels</b>, 	scattered in the upper layers of the dermis (creating telangiectasias within the papillary tips).</p>  	<p><b>Summary of the pathophysiology of psoriasis.</b> Psoriasis is characterized by immune dysregulation within the skin, 	with the appearance of cutaneous autoreactive T cells (Th1) producing IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#946; (2). Induction of an inflammatory 	milieu accelerates keratinocyte proliferation, leading to the development of epidermal hyperplasia (hyperkeratosis) and 	angiogenic tissue reactions, progressing to the increased skin vascularization and inflammatory cellular infiltrates 	that are the hallmarks of the psoriatic lesion. Normal skin contains both T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (7, 8) 	indicating a potential for triggering of recall immune responses to environmental agents. The lesions of psoriasis 	vulgaris contain large populations of leukocytes in addition to T cells and DCs, suggesting a function similar to 	organized lymphoid tissue that perpetuates immune infiltrates in psoriatic plagues. There is no good animal model 	for psoriasis; mouse and human skin are substantially different. Although some of the features of psoriasis 	(e.g. keritinocyte hyperplasia)can be obtained in transgenic or knock-out mice, the phenotypes include features 	of other dermatoses and neonatal lethality, which are not normally associated with human psoriasis (2). Thus, humans 	are the best experimental subjects in whom to study psoriasis. The availability of effective, systemic immunomodulatory 	agents in recent years has added resources for understanding pathogenesis (2, 3, 9, 10).</p> 	<p>Th1 T cell-inducing cytokines from dendritic cells (DC) drive the Th1 response observed in psoriasis, 	and thus are prime targets for disease control with anti-cytokine reagents (11). IL-12 and IL-23 are related 	molecules sharing a common p40 chain. Whereas IL-12 induces IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#946;, IL-23 induces IL-17 (12), TNF-&#946;, 	and IL-6; both play important roles in the psoriatic inflammatory response. IL-12/IL-23 production by cutaneous DC, 	and thus to Th1-driven inflammation, may be due to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation in the psoriatic lesions 	(via NF-kB stimulation). The role of TLRs in recognizing microbes implies a possible pathway for microbial involvement, 	at least in the final steps of psoriatic inflammation. The formation of a psoriatic plaque requires the continued 	presence of activated T cells specific for an unknown inciting antigen, and persistent T cell expression of plaque-inducing 	cytokines or cell-surface factors that form a "cytokine network." Thus, by the release of specific cytokines that act 	as growth factors or by cell-to-cell interactions, activated intra-dermal T cells trigger keratinocyte 	hyperproliferation. Subsequently, cytokines produced by stimulated nonlymphoid cells in the skin, such as 	keratinocyte-derived IL-8, chemotactic for neutrophils, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inducing 	the proliferation of the dermal vasculature, contribute to the inflammatory process. The triggers that initiate the 	inflammatory pathways are unknown, however, immunomodulatory agents are effective therapies (3, 9, 13).</p>  	<p><b>Small subunit ribosomal RNA diversity.</b> Investigation of ssrRNA gene sequences has revolutionized the study of 	microbial ecology, leading to fundamental new insights into the diversity present in the prokaryotic world. Further, it 	has underscored the major difference between the numbers of microbes cultured in the laboratory versus those present in 	the environment; thus, it has become a well-accepted method for interrogating diversity in environmental samples (14, 15). 	Diversity measurements using ssrRNA analyses have become an important complement to whole community or metagenomic 	sequencing. New approaches are constantly being developed to address diversity questions with respect to microbial 	communities, by focusing on the regions of the ribosomal operons that have the highest information content (see for example 16-19). 	</p> 	<p>Molecular analysis of the human microbiome has great potential (20-23). It has focused on fecal samples from 	the human GI tract (24) at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), and other centers (25-28), and in relation to 	disease (29, 30). Such studies have highlighted the extent of diversity associated with the human body. Other studies 	of the human Microbiome have focused on the oral cavity (31), upper gastrointestinal tract (32, 33), vagina (34-36), and 	on the skin (29, 37-41). Previous studies using ssrRNA approaches to study the diversity of the skin microbiome 	indicate that a community of microorganisms is consistently associated with the skin and is dominated by a median level 	of ~30-50 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the bacterial domain in individual hosts at any time in a single 	site (37). In total, based on previous studies, &gt;400 OTUs are predicted for superficial skin. The metabolic potential 	of these microbes has not been well-studied despite their fundamental importance to health and disease states of skin. 	Molecular studies of the fungal biota of the skin are in their infancy (99-41), but also are based on SSU sequences, 	especially the ITS1 and ITS2 loci (42-44).</p> 	<p>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause affecting 3% of the U.S. population. Its cause 	is unknown but there is evidence for extensive immune dysregulation. The role of the cutaneous microbiota in 	psoriasis has not been extensively examined which is surprising based on the evidence for inflammatory changes 	in tissues. Important questions that can be addressed by the proposed work include: Addressing such questions 	should enhance our knowledge about the diagnosis, prevention, natural history, and treatment of psoriasis.</p> 	<p> 		<ol> 			<li>Are there organisms whose presence or absence is a marker for psoriasis?</li> 			<li>Could a host&#39;s status with respect to an organism reflect propensity to develop psoriasis?</li> 			<li>Could specific organisms or their metabolic pathways correlate with psoriasis risk, and possibly 			explain the altered immunity?</li> 			<li>Since immunomodulatory therapy is not always successful, could the nature of the microbiota be a predictor 			for treatment success or failure?</li> 			<li>Will treatment of psoriasis with systemic therapy clear any abnormal microbiota, or do the abnormalities 			persist, suggesting a primary microbiological role in the disease?</li> 		</ol> 	</p>]]>
