	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The Pediatric Investigation for Genetic Factors Associated with Renal Progression (PediGFR) (RO1-DK082394) is an international collaborative study among three large prospective cohort studies of children with chronic kidney disease. The participating parent cohort studies are the "Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD)", the "Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition on CRF Progression in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE)", and the "Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (4C)" study. In these cohorts, pediatric subjects with CKD have been prospectively followed with standardized measurements for renal progression. The current version of the upload includes the genotype and baseline phenotype for the CKiD cohort. In brief the CKiD study is a prospective study of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) between the ages of 1 year to 16 years of age and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Schwartz equation between 30 and 75 ml/min per 1.73m<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>Included in this upload are the phenotypic data for anemia traits utilized for the sub-study, "Role of Genetic Variation in the Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease" (K24DK078737), with the RBC trait and anemia data pertaining to CKiD as well.</p>]]>
	</Description>
	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>The PediGFR utilized de-identified data from subjects who had consented for genetic testing, provided a sample of DNA, and who had data available for the renal trait phenotype as well and RBC trait and anemia phenotype. Exclusions are those who did not provide genetic consent, subject IDs whose genotyping did not pass quality control.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>The PediGFR study is an international collaborative study designed to determine the gene loci associated with renal progression in children. Genotyping of the US-based CKiD cohort occurred prior to the genotyping of the European cohorts (ESCAPE and 4C). Furthermore, the renal trait phenotype of cystatin C is being assayed for the European cohort. Given that the genotyping and phenotype data are complete for CKiD, these data are being uploaded as the first wave of data for PediGFR. The second wave of data for PediGFR including the European cohorts will be uploaded in the grant funding cycle of Aug 2013 to Sept 2014.</p> <p>Under PI Susan Furth, the ancillary study to utilize this genotyping data, "The Role of Genetic Variation in the Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease" is included for the data utilized for CKiD (wave 1), and subsequent to that ESCAPE and 4C (wave 2).</p>]]>
