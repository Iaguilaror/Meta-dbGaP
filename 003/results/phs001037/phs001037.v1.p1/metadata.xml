	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study investigates genetic and genetic-environmental interactions, including gestational infection or other gestational events, childhood infections and other environmental factors after birth, in relation to the development of pre-diabetic islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Beginning in 2002, a consortium of six centers assembled to participate in the development and implementation of studies to identify environmental factors that trigger the development of islet autoimmunity and T1D in genetically susceptible individuals. The TEDDY study screened around 400,000 newborns and recruited 7,749 neonates from the general population with a pre-determined T1D risk of 3% and 919 neonates with first degree relatives who have T1D and who have a pre-determined T1D risk of 10%. Thus, TEDDY proposes to follow over 8,000 participants across six clinical centers worldwide (Finland, Germany, Sweden and three in the United States) until the age of 15.</p> <p>Participants are followed every three months for islet autoantibody measurements with blood sampling until four years of age and then at least every six months until the age of 15. After the age of four, autoantibody positive subjects continue to be followed at 3 month intervals and autoantibody negative subjects are followed at six month intervals. In addition to the analysis of autoantibodies, additional data and sample collection is performed at each visit. The parents collect monthly stool samples in early childhood. The parents also fill out questionnaires at regular intervals in connection with study visits and record information about diet and health status in the child&#39;s TEDDY Book between visits. Continued long-term follow-up of the currently active TEDDY participants will provide important scientific information on early childhood diet, reported and measured infections, vaccinations, and psychosocial stressors that may contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes and islet autoimmunity.</p> <p>DNA extracted from the 9-month TEDDY blood sample was used for SNP genotyping. Samples were available for 7,082 participants. SNPs were genotyped by the Center for Public Health Genomics at the University of Virginia, using the Illumina ImmunoChip SNP microarray of around 196,000 SNPs selected from 186 regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases (including T1D) (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26010309">Hadley et al., 2015</a>). "Data quality control (QC) steps included eliminating subjects with a low call rate (&#62; 5% SNPs missing) and discrepancies between reported gender and prior genotyping at the HLA laboratory. Secondly, SNPs were removed from analysis due to low call rate, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P value &#60; 10<sup>-6</sup>, except for chromosome 6 due to HLA eligibility requirements)" (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25422107">T&#246;rn et al., 2015</a>). QC resulted in a total of 7,023 subjects with data on 176,586 SNPs.</p> <p>Additional information on the TEDDY study are available in the following articles: The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study.
