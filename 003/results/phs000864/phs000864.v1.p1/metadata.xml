	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The Genomic Predictors of Combat Stress Vulnerability and Resilience Study was designed to probe the likely hereditary basis for risk or resilience to develop PTSD and other trauma spectrum disorders. The overall guiding hypothesis was that genomic variation gives rise to risk/susceptibility traits that, when actuated by traumatic environmental stimuli, such as combat, give rise to PTSD and other stress-related phenotypes.</p> <p>Two studies designed to identify risk and resilience factors for combat-induced, stress-related symptoms are being conducted by our group: The Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) is a prospective PTSD study with longitudinal follow-up (pre- and post-exposure to combat stress) of US Marines bound for deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. Extensive phenotyping includes 3 domains: Psychosocial, Psychophysiologic, and Biophysiologic. The biological and physiological measures collected were chosen in part due to their potential to serve as intermediate phenotypes for stress-related disorders. A second, cross-sectional study involves a cohort of combat-exposed active duty or previously deployed service members (CAVC), including PTSD cases and controls with comparable psychosocial and clinical phenotypes.</p> <p>Little information is available about the factors that explain why some trauma survivors develop stress disorders and some do not. It is hoped that the insights gained from this approach will improve understanding of the genetic contributors to PTSD, and potentially provide novel diagnostic tests and therapeutic approaches to this currently enigmatic and difficult-to-manage condition.</p>]]>

		<Description>We recruited a cohort of 3,830 veterans who were evaluated for PTSD. All subjects met criteria A for PTSD. Cases were designated as those who met the DSM-IV definition for PTSD (including the A1 criteria, but not A2) and controls were those who did not. Subjects were genotyped on Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome arrays (on two platforms). Each subject&#39;s ancestry was genetically determined and subjects were clustered into one of four ancestral subgroups: European (N=2,356), African (N=232), Hispanic/Native American (N=708), or other (including East Asian; N=534). GWAS for PTSD were run on each ancestral subgroup. The association results presented are from a meta-analysis of GWAS results across all subgroups</Description>
