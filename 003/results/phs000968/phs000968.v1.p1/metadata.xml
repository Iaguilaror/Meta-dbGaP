	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The study was initially designed as a longitudinal cohort study of cardiovascular effects of particulate exposure. Participants were boilermaker construction workers who were exposed to particulate matter (PM) component (e.g. a focus on metal constituents) while performing welding, grinding or cutting work in the welding plants. Participants were followed up approximately half a year for a non-work day and a work day from 1999 to 2012, and blood, urine, blood pressure, as well as real-time PM2.5 samples were collected from each participant. In this specific study, we conducted epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling through Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) services using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450, which will give us more compete epigenome-wide coverage. Genome-wide DNA methylation was carried out on paired samples pre- and post-work shift at a welding apprentice school. With transcriptomic and metabolomic data already generated from the same panel study, we will be able to conduct integrative analysis to gain insights into mechanisms of gene-metal interactions and maximize the probability of finding genes functionally relevant to PM-induced adverse cardiovascular outcomes. </p>]]>
