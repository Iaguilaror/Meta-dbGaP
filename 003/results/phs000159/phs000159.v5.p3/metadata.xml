	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>We used massively parallel sequencing technology to sequence the genomic DNA of tumor cells (leukemic bone marrow) and normal cells (skin biopsy) obtained from patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Patients had either de novo AML (AML with no prior diagnosis of a hematologic disease or exposure to chemotherapy), secondary AML (occurring after a prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)), or therapy-related AML (occurring after exposure to prior chemotherapy). We identified somatic mutations in the tumor genomes, including single nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and structural variants.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>Case presentation of UPN 933124. A previously healthy Caucasian female in her late 50s presented with a sudden onset of sore throat and easy bruisability. There was no antecedent history of prior cancer, or administration of cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation therapy. The patient&#39;s family history was obtained by a trained genetic counselor and was positive for late onset cancers in her mother and several of her mother&#39;s siblings, including a maternal uncle with a reported case of AML that was confirmed by death certificate. The patient&#39;s sister has Essential Thrombocythemia (JAK2 V617F negative). None of the patient&#39;s children had a history of cancer. The patient&#39;s pedigree is being withheld from this report to protect the privacy of the family. The patient was found to have a peripheral blood white blood cell count of 105,000 cells per microliter with 85% blasts on presentation. The hemoglobin was 12.1 grams per deciliter, and platelet count was 20,000 per microliter. A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate revealed 100% blasts, and confirmed the diagnosis of AML, FAB M1 subtype. Flow cytometry revealed a single population of myeloblasts with cell surface expression of CD-13, -33 and -117, and absent expression of CD-34 and HLA-DR. Cytogenetic analysis of tumor cells revealed a normal 46 XX karyotype. After informed consent was obtained, she was enrolled in a cooperative group protocol for treatment of AML in adults less than age 60 (Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) #19808), and a Washington University Human Studies Committee-approved protocol for tissue banking in patients with MDS and AML (HSC #01-1014). Specimens of bone marrow, peripheral blood, and skin were collected and cryopreserved for genomic studies. After emergent leukopheresis, she underwent induction chemotherapy with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide. A bone marrow biopsy repeated 2 weeks later demonstrated chemoablation. After myeloid recovery, a repeat bone marrow biopsy demonstrated first complete remission. On the basis of her intermediate risk cytogenetics, she was assigned to undergo consolidation chemotherapy with high dose cytarabine and etoposide, followed by filgrastim to facilitate autologous hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection. She subsequently underwent dose-intensive busulfan and etoposide conditioning, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue. Upon recovery from autologous stem cell transplantation, she was assigned to receive maintenance immunotherapy with IL-2. Despite these multiple therapies, she relapsed 11 months after her initial diagnosis. After failing to respond to a salvage regimen of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine, she received fludarabine, high dose Ara-C, idarubicin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 10 days later she received high dose cyclophosphamide conditioning (60 mg/kg daily x 2) and then single dose total body irradiation (550 cGy; 30 cGy/min) followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor. A bone marrow biopsy performed one month after transplantation confirmed second complete remission. Unfortunately, her disease relapsed four months later. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was again administered, followed by two donor lymphocyte infusions, without clearance of circulating blasts. She was then successively treated with azacytidine, low dose cytarabine, and decitabine, again without appreciable response, and expired 24 months after her initial diagnosis. Informed consent for whole genome sequencing was subsequently obtained from her next of kin and family members, using a revised Washington University Human Studies Committee-approved protocol that specifically addresses privacy and confidentiality issues associated with whole genome sequencing (HSC #01-1014, Amendment #17).</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 807970. A 38-year-old Caucasian male who was previously in good health presented with fatigue and a cough. The white blood cell count was 39,800/ul with 97% blasts, the hemoglobin was 8.9 g/dl, and the platelet count was 35,000/ul. A bone marrow examination revealed 90% cellularity and 86% myeloperoxidase positive blasts. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow sample revealed a uniform population of cells in the blast gate that stained for CD33 and CD117, but not CD13, CD14, CD34, or HLA-DR. Routine cytogenetics of the bone marrow samples revealed a normal 46 XY karyotype. The bone marrow and skin samples were banked with informed consent for whole genome sequencing on a protocol approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board. The patient&#39;s Unique Patient Number (UPN) on the protocol was 807970. There was no family history of leukemia. The patient&#39;s mother developed breast cancer at age 60, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma at age 63; her half sister developed breast cancer at age 50. The patient was treated initially with a 7-day course of infusional cytarabine, and three days of daunorubicin. He obtained a morphologic complete remission and count recovery within 5 weeks. The patient was consolidated with high-dose cytarabine for four cycles, and has had no further therapy. He remains in complete remission 3 years later.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 189941. A 37 year-old female presented with Stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, Her2-positive breast cancer and was treated with surgery, local radiotherapy and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin). At age 39, she was diagnosed with Stage IIIC ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (FIGO grade III), and she was treated with surgery and chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel). Her ovarian cancer recurred at age 42, and she received additional chemotherapy. Six months later, she presented with t-AML. Analysis of her bone marrow revealed 76% blasts with monocytic features and a complex karyotype involving monosomy 7, del(5q), and two marker chromosomes that could not be resolved by standard cytogenetic analysis. She developed respiratory failure and died 8 days after presentation. Of note, her family history did not suggest an inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome. Specifically, no cancers were reported in 6 first degree relatives (parents, brother, and 3 children) and only a single case of cancer (leg sarcoma at age 62 in a maternal grandfather) was reported in 10 second degree relatives. Nonetheless, the early onset of both breast and ovarian cancer prompted commercial testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which was negative.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 757128. We used massively parallel sequencing technology to sequence the genomic DNA of tumor and normal skin cells obtained from a patient with a typical clinical presentation of acute promyelocytic leukemia, who had no evidence of the classic t(15;17) translocation, but presented with pancytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and increased bone marrow promyelocytes. She was treated with standard induction therapy using cytarabine and idarubicin, but had persistent bone marrow leukemia at day 14. She entered a complete remission following reinduction with cytarabine, idarubicin and etoposide. She was empirically consolidated with arsenic trioxide. As a result of the whole genome sequencing results, she was further treated with all-trans retinoic acid maintenance therapy and remains in remission 15 months after presentation.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 461282. A 65 year old male with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) received supportive care only (erythropoietin, RBC transfusion) until MDS banking on day 1077 after initial diagnosis. He had a complex karyotype at MDS banking consisting of: -17,del(20)(q11.2),r[5]/idem,del(5)(q31q33)[10]/idem,del(5)(q13q33)[3]/ idem,-X,add(X)(q22),der(12)t(12;?)del(12)(q22)[2]. He then received 11 cycles of decitabine, followed by 3 cycles of lenalidomide. On day 1755 (day 660 after MDS banking) he progressed to sAML. At sAML banking his karyotype showed: del(5)(q22q33),-17,del(20(q11.2)[14]. He then underwent standard induction ("7+3"), followed by salvage chemotherapy (fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, and filgrastim) for induction failure. He then proceeded to a matched, unrelated stem cell transplant with fludarabine/busulfan/thymoglobulin conditioning. He had evidence of persistent disease at day+30 following transplant, received two cycles of decitabine, and died of progressive leukemia on day 2009 (day 932 after MDS banking). The patient&#39;s past medical history was notable for basal cell carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, all treated surgically without adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. A sister and two nieces had early onset breast cancer (age&lt;40). One niece also had a neuroendocrine tumor and clinical testing revealed an inherited deleterious TP53 variant.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 667720. A 66 year old female with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) was treated initially with supportive care (erythropoietin and RBC transfusions) until MDS banking on day 8, followed by four cycles of decitabine. She was then observed until sAML progression at day 667 (day 659 after MDS banking). Her karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. She received one further cycle of decitabine, followed by supportive care until her death on day 724 (day 716 after MDS banking).</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 610184. A 45 year old female with refractory anemia (RA) was observed for one year, then received 3 cycles of lenalidomide prior to MDS banking on day 162 after diagnosis. She had a complex karyotype at MDS banking consisting of: add(1)(p36.3),del(5)(q13q33),-13,dic(16;21)(p13.3;q11.2),add(17)(p13),-18,-22. She received no further therapy until progression to sAML on day 314 (day 152 after MDS banking). Her karyotype at sAML banking showed: add(1)(p36.3),del(5)(q13q33),-7,-13,dic(16;21)(p13.3;p11.2),add(17)(p13),-18,-22,+mar[cp17]. She then underwent standard induction chemotherapy ("7+3"), followed by salvage chemotherapy (mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine) for induction failure. On day 398 (day 236 after MDS banking), she underwent a matched, unrelated donor transplant, relapsed, and died of progressive disease on day 589 (day 427 after MDS banking).</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 182896. A 75 year old male with refractory anemia (RA) was observed until MDS banking on day 69 after diagnosis. His karyotype at MDS banking showed: +8 [6]. He then received supportive care only (RBC transfusion) until sAML progression on day 1047 (day 978 after MDS banking). His karyotype at sAML banking showed: +3, +8, +9, -12, +15, +19, +22 [cp11]. He then received 5 cycles of decitabine and intermittent hydroxyurea until he died from progressive disease on day 1205 (day 1136 after MDS banking).</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 266395. A 65 year old male with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) treated with supportive care (erythropoietin, RBC transfusion) until MDS banking on day 46 after initial diagnosis. He received one month of hydroxyurea before sAML progression on day 76 (day 30 after MDS banking). His karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. He required emergency leukopheresis, followed by 5-azacytidine for 6 cycles. He then developed CNS leukemia and received supportive care only until his death on day 321 after diagnosis (day 275 after MDS banking).</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 288033. A 31 year old female with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) at diagnosis and MDS banking was observed until sAML progression on day 28. Her karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. She underwent induction chemotherapy (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide), followed by reinduction and salvage chemotherapy Page 2 of 100 before proceeding to a matched, unrelated donor transplant. She died of graft-versus-host disease on day 367 (day 367 after MDS diagnosis).</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 298273. A 27 year old male with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) at diagnosis and MDS banking received 3 cycles of an oral angiogenesis inhibitor (Vatalanib) on a clinical trial until sAML progression on day 131. His karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. He then received one cycle of 5-azacytidine, followed by a matched, unrelated donor transplant. He relapsed on day 257 and received salvage chemotherapy, but died of graft-versus-host disease on day 540 (day 514 after MDS banking).</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 400220. A 34 year old Caucasian female with a prior history of cervical carcinoma in situ (treated with LEEP procedure), mitral valve prolapse, and endometriosis, presented with fatigue, allergy symptoms and chest pain. A CBC demonstrated WBC 14,500 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 11.5 g/dl, platelets 139,000 cells/mcl, with 58% circulating blasts. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 90% cellularity, with 71% myeloblasts (MPX +, NSE -, CD13/33/34/117/HLA-DR+), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M4. Cytogenetics showed a 46 XX karyotype. Molecular diagnostic studies demonstrated a FLT3 internal tandem duplication. Initial therapy consisted of 7 +3 induction regimen with infusional cytarabine and idarubicin. A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy revealed ablation, and a subsequent biopsy documented first complete remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of 3 cycles of high dose cytarabine. Relapse was documented 8 months after initial diagnosis. The patient underwent salvage chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high dose cytarabine (MEC) with concurrent plerixafor, but did not achieve remission. She was subsequently treated with fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, idarubicin, and gemtuzumab with concurrent filgrastim, and subsequently underwent matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation with active disease. She expired at day +7 post transplant, 10 months from initial diagnosis.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 426980.

Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, daunorubicin, and concurrent oblimersen (Genasense, a BCL2 antisense molecule). A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy revealed ablation, and a subsequent biopsy documented first complete remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of 2 cycles of high dose cytarabine with concurrent oblimersin. Relapse was documented 26 months from diagnosis. Salvage chemotherapy regimens were administered sequentially with no or minimal response including decitabine, high dose cytarabine, mitoxantrone and etoposide, azacytidine, and palliative hydroxyurea. He expired from progressive disease 48 months following his initial diagnosis.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 452198. A 55 year old Caucasian male, previously healthy, presented with fatigue, subjective fevers, and sinus congestion. A CBC demonstrated: WBC 72,600 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 8.2 g/dl, platelets 17,000 cells/mcl, with 8% circulating blasts and 50% monocytes. A bone marrow biopsy was inevaluable for cellularity. The aspirate demonstrated 97 % monoblasts (MPX -, NSE +, CD13/33/64+), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M5. Cytogenetics showed a 46 XY karyotype. Initial therapy consisted of hydroxyurea for two days, followed by 7 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine and idarubicin.

The aspirate demonstrated 51% myeloblasts (sparse MPX+, NSE low, CD13/33/34/56/117+), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M4. Cytogenetics showed a 46 XY karyotype. Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide. A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy was ablated, and a subsequent biopsy following marrow recovery documented first complete remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of high dose cytarabine and etoposide, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation with busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning. Relapse was documented seven months from diagnosis, and treated with fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, idarubicin, and gemtuzumab with concurrent filgrastim, resulting in second complete remission. He subsequently underwent matched sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant 12 months from initial diagnosis, but relapsed two months later. Subsequent treatment included: clofarabine and high dose cytarabine; decitabine; and cladribine, high dose cytarabine, and imatinib, as well as serial donor lymphocyte infusions, without achieving remission. He expired from progressive disease 19 months from initial diagnosis.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 758168. A previously healthy 25 year old Caucasian female presented with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and decreased visual acuity in her left eye. A CBC demonstrated WBC 3,500 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 5.9 g/dl, platelets 24,000 cells/mcl, with circulating promyelocytes. Diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) was present (INR of 3.2 and fibrinogen 88 mg/dl). A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hypercellularity, with 93% promyelocytes (MPX +, NSE -, CD13/33+), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M3. Cytogenetics showed a t(15;17) translocation. Ophthalmologic evaluation demonstrated retinal hemorrhage, detachment, and acute glaucoma, resulting in irreversible loss of vision and eventual enucleation. Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, idarubicin, and concurrent ATRA, complicated by headaches attributed to pseudotumor cerebri (CSF negative for malignancy). A bone marrow biopsy following marrow recovery documented first complete remission. Following induction, additional ATRA was withheld because it was presumed to be the cause of her pseudotumor cerebri. Post-remission therapy consisted of 3 cycles of "anthracycline" administered by the referring oncologist, followed by planned arsenic trioxide maintenance (prematurely aborted due to noncompliance). Relapse was documented 32 months from diagnosis, and was treated with arsenic trioxide, resulting in second complete remission. She subsequently underwent matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation 4 months later, complicated by acute and chronic graft vs host disease and recurrent infection. She expired while in remission 50 months from initial diagnosis (14 months post transplant) from infectious complications of her transplant.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 804168.

A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy revealed ablation, and a subsequent biopsy following marrow recovery documented first complete remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of 2 cycles of high dose cytarabine. Relapse was documented 8 months from diagnosis, and was treated with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high dose cytarabine with concurrent plerixafor, following which residual disease was documented (5-7% blasts). He subsequently underwent matched sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant following conditioning with single dose total body irradiation and high dose cyclophosphamide, but relapsed 1 month post transplant. Subsequent salvage therapy included decitabine, which yielded a third remission. He subsequently developed extramedullary relapse that was treated with radiation, and died of progressive disease 30 months from initial diagnosis.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 123172 (AML3). 56 year old Caucasian male with a remote history of rheumatic heart disease and aortic valve replacement, presented with a one month history of unexplained fever, night sweats, and 12 pound weight loss. A CBC demonstrated: WBC 30,500 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 9.6 g/dl, platelets 88,000 cells/mcl, with 45% circulating blasts.

She remains alive and in remission 58 months from initial diagnosis.</p> <p>Case presentation of UPN 849660 (AML5). 22 year old Caucasian male, previously healthy, presented with a 2 month history of unintentional 15 pound weight loss, night sweats, and soft tissue infections (skin/gingival). A CBC demonstrated: WBC 167,500 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 7.1 g/dl, platelets 41,000 cells/mcl, with 88% circulating blasts. Diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) was present with an INR of 3.2 and fibrinogen 88 mg/dl. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 90 % cellularity, with 71 % myeloblasts (MPX +, NSE -, CD13/33/34/117+), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M1. Cytogenetics showed a 46 XY karyotype. Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide. A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy showed &lt;10% cellularity, but was suggestive of persistent leukemia with 18% residual blasts. A subsequent biopsy following marrow recovery clearly documented persistent disease, and he was treated with a salvage regimen of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high dose cytarabine, following which complete remission was achieved. He subsequently underwent matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation in CR1 following fractionated total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide conditioning, five months after initial diagnosis. Relapse was documented at three months post transplant, and he underwent salvage chemotherapy with fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, and idarubicin, following which a second complete remission was achieved. He subsequently three serial donor lymphocyte infusions, and remained in remission for over a year before relapsing again, 24 months from his initial diagnosis. He was treated with a salvage regimen of clofarabine and high dose cytarabine, following which a third complete remission was achieved.
