	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) is a community-based prospective epidemiologic cohort of 28,449 subjects who were recruited for baseline examination between 1991 and 1996. From this cohort, 6103 subjects were randomly selected to participate in a cardiovascular cohort (MDCSCC), which seeks to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This study is a subset of those samples.</p> <p>All exome sequencing was performed at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT; samples sequence capture was performed using Illumina&#39;s ICE Capture reagent and sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>We performed a nested case-control experiment for incident cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular events are defined as myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. We included participants who passed the following sample quality control measures: contamination &lt; 5%, missingness &lt; 5%, concordance with genome-wide array data when available, and Ti/Tv, total variants / depth, and F inbreeding coefficient outliers. We also excluded individuals who were genotypically found to be within three degrees of relatedness.</p> <p>Cases include those who developed cardiovascular events after a median follow-up of 17.1 years. We excluded individuals who had clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline examination. Controls were matched to each case in the matched nested case-control experiment. Controls were matched for age (+/- 2 years), sex, smoking status, type 2 diabetes status.</p>]]>
