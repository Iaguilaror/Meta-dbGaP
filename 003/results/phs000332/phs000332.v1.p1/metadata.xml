	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Preterm birth (PTB, born before 37 weeks of gestation) accounts for 12.5% of all births in the U.S. It is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and post-natal morbidity. The highest rate of PTB occurs among the black population (17.8%). Available literature and our research findings strongly suggest that genetic factors play an important role in PTB. Supported by a grant from the NICHD, the goal of this project is to conduct a genome-wide association (GWA) study and apply advanced statistical methods to identify susceptibility loci of PTB. We will genotype 1,000 black mothers who delivered preterm births (cases) and 1,000 age-matched black mothers who delivered term births (controls) at the Boston Medical Center (BMC), using the Illumina HumanOmni 2.5 array. Subsequently, we will perform replication analysis of the SNPs using independent, multi-ethnic samples from the BMC. We also will genotype the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in babies born to the study mothers, and examine if the fetal gene interacts with the maternal gene to affect the risk of PTB.</p> <p>PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: We anticipate that this study will lead to the identification of novel genetic loci of PTB. Such findings not only will provide important insights into mechanisms leading to PTB, but also may help identify women at high-risk of PTB, which in turn, may lead to the development of early and targeted interventions that can prevent PTB or mitigate the severity and consequences of PTB.</p>]]>

<p><b>Criteria for cases</b> <ol type="A"> <li><b>Inclusion:</b> All mothers who delivered preterm babies (&lt;37 weeks of gestation, regardless of birthweight) at Boston Medical Center (BMC) were eligible as cases for the study.</li> <li><b>Exclusion:</b> We excluded pregnancies as a result of <i>in vitro</i> fertilization or multiple gestation, and fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities or major birth defects. Additional exclusion criteria include mothers with congenital or acquired uterus lesions or with a known history of incompetent cervix, and preterm births due to maternal trauma (e.g., car accident).</li> </ol> </p> <p><b>Criteria for controls</b></p> <p>Those mothers who delivered term (&gt;38.5 weeks of gestation) normal birthweight (&gt;2,500 grams) babies at BMC and matched with case mothers on race, age (&#177; 5 years) and parity were eligible as controls for this GWAS.</p>]]>
