	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>108 individuals (age 21-89+ years; 59% males, 41% females; 89% Caucasian; not recruited based on any specific phenotype) participated in an IRB-approved study from April 2014 to January 2015. Each individual had the genome sequenced in full. Blood was collected in clinics every three months. Additionally, participants completed at-home collections of saliva, stool, and first morning void urine every three months. Stool and saliva samples were shipped directly to the vendor by the participant, while urine was given back to the study coordinators for distribution to the proper sample vendor. For each successful participant in each round we carried out 218 clinical laboratory tests, measured up to 643 metabolites and 262 proteins, and measured the abundance of 4616 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing.</p> <p>The P100 study had four objectives: 1) Establish cost-efficient procedures for generating, storing and analyzing multiple sources of health data obtained over time from participants and analyzed in combination with genomic data; 2) Develop and deploy analytic tools for integrating these diverse datasets and deriving actionable information from their observed interrelationships; 3) Identify novel patterns within the streams of health data that indicate either wellness, or transitions between wellness and disease; 4) Learn how to best interface with and present longitudinal health information to individuals by studying the reactions and feedback from participants as they are presented actionable information.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Individuals in Washington state and California were informally identified as interested in the P100 via personal communication and social networks of the authors. These individuals were then sent a formal email announcement of the study from Leroy Hood with an invitation to join. Procedures for the P100 were run under the Western Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol Number 20121979) at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB). All 108 participants gave written informed consent for analysis of their data.</p>]]>
