	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Non-syndromic cryptorchidism is a common malformation, but the genetic loci that increase susceptibility to cryptorchidism remain unknown. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was completed to determine whether common allelic variants are associated with susceptibility to cryptorchidism. Two sets of discovery groups were genotyped. Group 1 (559 cases and 1772 controls) was genotyped with HumanHap550v1.0, HumanHap550v3.0 or Human610-quad v1.0. Group 2 (353 cases and 1149 controls) was genotyped with HumanOmniExpress-12v1 or HumanOmniExpress-12v1-1. The sample and marker QCs were performed separately using PLINK (v1.07; <a href="http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/" target="_blank">http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/</a>) and logistic regression analyses were performed with first and second multidimensional scaling (MDS) components as covariates.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Cases were unrelated Caucasian non-syndromic cryptorchidism patients. Exclusion criteria included multiple congenital anomalies; diagnosis of a syndrome; presence of other genital anomalies such as hypospadias, chordee or other penile anomalies; abdominal wall defects or syndromic urogenital malformation sequences. Controls were Caucasian males &#8805; 7 years with no known history of testicular disease, and without penile anomaly, diagnosis of a syndrome or any additional medical disorder associated with cryptorchidism.</p>]]>

		<Description>Purpose of the analysis: Nonsyndromic cryptorchidism is a common malformation with familial aggregation suggesting genetic susceptibility. The genetic loci that contribute to cryptorchidism remain unknown; however, human and animal pedigrees and our linkage analysis of the cryptorchid orl rat strain support polygenic inheritance.  Platforms and sample size: Two sets of sample groups were genotyped. One group (559 cases and 1772 controls) was genotyped with HumanHap550v1.0, HumanHap550v v3.0 or Human610-quad v1.0. The other group (353 cases and 1149 controls) was genotyped with HumanOmniExpress-12v1 or HumanOmniExpress-12v1-1.  Phenotype trait: nonsyndromic cryptorchidism.</Description>
