	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery  Act investment,    was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with    heart, lung and blood diseases.  These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from    diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied.  These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease,    contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention    and treatments to specific populations.  This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects.     GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers -    BroadGO and SeattleGO.</p>   <p>The major goal of this project is to apply second generation resequencing technology to identify disease causing variants 	influencing pediatric and adult lung diseases in a collection of two longitudinal population cohorts of cystic fibrosis 	patients that have been well characterized for a comprehensive set of clinical traits.  Exome sequencing was performed 	on 43 cystic fibrosis patients with early <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa)</i> infection and 48 cystic fibrosis patients 	with late <i>Pa</i> infection to identify variants influencing the time to onset of <i>Pa</i> infection.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa)</i> is a ubiquitous environmental organism and the most significant pathogen in 	cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Early Pa acquisition is a major concern for CF care providers given that chronic 	infection with this pathogen is associated with significant CF morbidity and mortality.  Two longitudinal population 	cohorts of cystic fibrosis patients that have been well characterized for a comprehensive set of clinical traits for 	the study of Pa acquisition have contributed to this project. The first cohort, Early Pseudomonas Infection 	Control (CFES-CF1), the world&#39;s largest, multicenter, longitudinal, prospective cohort of early lung disease 	in young CF patients and consists of 1,704 CF cases who were ages &#8804; 12 years old with no prior isolation 	of <i>Pa</i> or at least a two-year history of <i>Pa</i> negative cultures.  The second cohort, the NHLBI-GWAS 	to Identify CF Modifiers (CFES-CF2), consists of 1,208 who are at the extremes of lung disease severity.</p> 	<p>Exome resequencing of phenotypic extremes represents a cost-effective and robust strategy for the sensitive 	and specific identification of variants causing protein-coding changes influencing risk for complex traits.</p>]]>
