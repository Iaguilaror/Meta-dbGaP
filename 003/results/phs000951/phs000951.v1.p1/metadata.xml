	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the only leading cause of death that is steadily increasing in frequency. This project established a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,371 subjects were recruited, including control smokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 or GOLD-Unclassified). This cohort is being used for cross-sectional analysis, and long-term longitudinal follow-up after five years is also being performed. The primary focus of the study is to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. <b>The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease.</b> The TOPMed analysis will include 1900 severe COPD and smoking control subjects with whole genome sequencing.</p> <p>Comprehensive phenotypic data for COPDGene subjects is available through dbGaP entry <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000179.v4.p2">phs179.v4.p2</a>.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>The COPDGene Study was funded by the NHLBI in October 2007 as two U01 grants-one to National Jewish Medical and Research Center (PI: James D. Crapo) and one to Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital (PI: Edwin K. Silverman). After a pilot study in 2007, study recruitment began in February 2008 at 21 clinical centers throughout the United States. In 2012, the NHLBI funded longitudinal assessment of the COPDGene cohort and additional genetic analysis through paired R01 grants.</p>]]>
