	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.</p> <p>As part of this initiative, the Broad has performed genotyping on several thousand subjects from 4 different cohorts on Illumina&#39;s ExomeChip platform as described below: <ol> <li>The Duke Study: The Duke study enrolled cases from the Duke University Medical Center with myocardial infarction or coronary artery stenosis &gt; 50%. Controls were individuals who were &gt; 50 years old without coronary stenosis &gt; 30% and without history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, or heart transplant.</li> <li>The InterMountain Heart Study: The Intermountain Heart Study is an observational registry of individuals with coronary artery disease and healthy controls who received care at participating Intermountain Healthcare facilities.</li> <li>The Ottawa Heart Study: The Ottawa heart study enrolled cases with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (&gt; 1 coronary artery with &gt; 50% stenosis) who did not have type 2 diabetes and were &#8804; 50 years old for males and &#8804; 50 years old for females. Controls were also enrolled who were asymptomatic males &gt; age 65 and females &gt; age 70.</li> <li>PennCATH: PennCATH is a case-control study that recruited individuals undergoing coronary angiography at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. Cases had angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (&gt;1 coronary artery with 50% stenosis) and were &#8804; 55 years old if male and &#8804; 60 years old if female. Controls were men &gt; 40 years old and women &gt; 45 years old with normal coronary angiography.</li> </ol> </p>]]>
