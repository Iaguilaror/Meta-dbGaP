	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this study was to identify genetic risk factors for drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval (diLQT) and  	the ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes (TdP). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing on subjects  	with a history of long QT and/or TdP after taking medication. Controls for this study were individuals with a history of  	cardiac arrhythmias who had begun treatment with potentially QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics. An additional control group of  	normal volunteers were given ibutilide, a drug with documented proarrhythmic properties. All study participants were recruited  	and treated/evaluated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p>  	<p>This study was conducted by the Pharmacogenomics of Arrhythmia Therapy subgroup of the Pharmacogenetics Research Network,  	a nationwide collaboration of scientists studying the genetic contributions to drug response variability. Genotyping was  	performed by the RIKEN research institute in Japan using the Illumina 610 Quad Beadchip platform.</p>]]>
