<p><b>The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA):</b>  GENOA is one of four research networks that form the NHLBI     Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP).  From its inception in 1995, GENOA&#39;s long-term objective was to elucidate the genetics of     hypertension and its arteriosclerotic target-organ damage, including both atherosclerotic (macrovascular) and arteriolosclerotic     (microvascular) complications involving the heart, brain, kidneys, and peripheral arteries.  Two GENOA cohorts were originally     ascertained (1995-2000) through sibships in which at least 2 siblings had essential hypertension diagnosed prior to age 60 years.     All siblings in the sibship were invited to participate, both normotensive and hypertensive.  These include non-Hispanic White Americans     from Rochester, MN (n =1583 at the 1st exam) and African Americans from Jackson, MS (N=1854 at the 1st exam).  During the     second exam (2000-2005), approximately 80% of participants were re-recruited.  The GENOA data consists of biological samples     (DNA, serum, urine) as well as demographic, anthropometric, environmental, clinical, biochemical, physiological, and genetic data     for understanding the genetic predictors of diseases of the heart, brain, kidney, and peripheral arteries.</p>     <p><b>Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP):</b>  GENOA&#39;s parent program, the FBPP, is an unprecedented collaboration to     identify genes influencing blood pressure (BP) levels, hypertension, and its target-organ damage.  This program has conducted     over 21,000 physical examinations, assembled a shared database of several hundred BP and hypertension-related phenotypic measurements,     completed genome-wide linkage analyses for BP, hypertension, and hypertension associated risk factors and complications, and published     over 130 manuscripts on program findings.  The FBPP emerged from what was initially funded as four independent networks of investigators     (HyperGEN, GenNet, SAPPHIRe and GENOA) competing to identify genetic determinants of hypertension in multiple ethnic groups.  Realizing     the greater likelihood of success through collaboration, the investigators began working together during the first funding     cycle (1995-2000) and formalized this arrangement in the second cycle (2000-2005), creating a single confederation with program-wide     and network-specific goals.</p>]]>

Exclusion criteria for the white and African American cohorts were secondary hypertension, alcoholism or drug abuse, pregnancy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or active malignancy. Data were collected during two phases (Phase I from 1995-2000, Phase II from 2001-2004) and multiple ancillary studies.
<p>A total of 1464 non-Hipanic white participants were genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 array (N=1345) or the Illumina Human1M-Duo or Human660W-Quad BeadChips (N=119).  Imputation was performed using the single-step approach implemented in Markov Chain Haplotyper (MaCH) 1.0.16. Genome-wide association was performed using imputed genotype dosages for nine quantitative traits related to hypertension or arteriosclerotic target-organ damage using linear mixed modeling to account for family structure. Here, genome-wide association results are reported for coronary artery calcification (CAC), adjusted for age and sex (N=1043).

The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) is one of four research networks that form the NHLBI Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP).  Two GENOA cohorts were originally ascertained (1995-2000) through sibships in which at least 2 siblings had essential hypertension diagnosed prior to 60 years of age.  All siblings in the sibship were invited to participate, both normotensive and hypertensive.  Participants include non-Hispanic White Americans from Rochester, MN (n =1583 at the initial examination) and African Americans from Jackson, MS (N=1854 at the initial examination).  Exclusion criteria for the white and African American cohorts were secondary hypertension, alcoholism or drug abuse, pregnancy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or active malignancy. Data were collected during two phases (Phase I from 1995-2000, Phase II from 2001-2004) and multiple ancillary studies.
<p>A total of 1464 non-Hipanic white participants were genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 array (N=1345) or the Illumina Human1M-Duo or Human660W-Quad BeadChips (N=119).  Imputation was performed using the single-step approach implemented in Markov Chain Haplotyper (MaCH) 1.0.16. Genome-wide association was performed using imputed genotype dosages for nine quantitative traits related to hypertension or arteriosclerotic target-organ damage using linear mixed modeling to account for family structure. Here, genome-wide association results are reported for ankle brachial index (ABI), adjusted for age and sex (N=1063). Please see the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/GetPdf.cgi?id=phd003593.1">GENOA Study Documentation</a> for further details.</p>

The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) is one of four research networks that form the NHLBI Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP).  Two GENOA cohorts were originally ascertained (1995-2000) through sibships in which at least 2 siblings had essential hypertension diagnosed prior to 60 years of age.  All siblings in the sibship were invited to participate, both normotensive and hypertensive.  Participants include non-Hispanic White Americans from Rochester, MN (n =1583 at the initial examination) and African Americans from Jackson, MS (N=1854 at the initial examination).  Exclusion criteria for the white and African American cohorts were secondary hypertension, alcoholism or drug abuse, pregnancy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or active malignancy. Data were collected during two phases (Phase I from 1995-2000, Phase II from 2001-2004) and multiple ancillary studies.
<p>A total of 1464 non-Hipanic white participants were genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 array (N=1345) or the Illumina Human1M-Duo or Human660W-Quad BeadChips (N=119).  Imputation was performed using the single-step approach implemented in Markov Chain Haplotyper (MaCH) 1.0.16. Genome-wide association was performed using imputed genotype dosages for nine quantitative traits related to hypertension or arteriosclerotic target-organ damage using linear mixed modeling to account for family structure. Here, genome-wide association results are reported for ankle brachial index (ABI), adjusted for age, sex, and top 10 PCs (N=1242).
