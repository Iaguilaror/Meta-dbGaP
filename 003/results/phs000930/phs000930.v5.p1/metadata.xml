	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>GWAS have successfully identified genetic loci associated with a variety of conditions such as type 2 diabetes and coronary disease. The large number of statistical tests required in GWAS has posed a special challenge because few studies that have DNA and high-quality phenotype data are sufficiently large to provide adequate statistical power for detecting small to modest effect sizes. Even before the era of GWAS, the requirement for large sample sizes and the importance of replication have served as powerful incentives for collaboration. Meta-analyses combining summary data from multiple sources have improved the ability to detect new loci. The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium was formed to facilitate GWAS meta-analyses and replication among multiple large and well-phenotyped cohort studies. The design of the CHARGE Consortium was formed initially from 5 prospective cohort studies from the United States and Europe: the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) - Reykjavik Study, the <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000280">Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study</a>, the <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000287">Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)</a>, the <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000007">Framingham Heart Study (FHS)</a>, and the Rotterdam Study (RS). Additional studies have expanded the CHARGE consortium based upon the phenotypes and willingness to share information across the research community.</p> <p>In order to facilitate investigators across the world to examine relationships between phenotypes and genetic markers within CHARGE published reports, an open site is made available on dbGaP that provides the rsID and the p-value for inspection. Access to detailed summary statistics (including minor allele frequency, odds ratio/effect size) requires approval of a Data Access Request (DAR).</p>]]>

<p>To be included in a CHARGE study, a cohort has to provide summary statistics for meta-analyses according to the specifications of the CHARGE Working Group. The summary statistics are based upon an agreed-upon analytic plan that provides guidance for all protocols and software.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>A major goal of the CHARGE Consortium is to collaboratively produce a series of jointly coordinated, high-impact publications that describes the collaborative results of genome-wide association scans (GWAS) for a number of cardiovascular, lung, blood and aging phenotypes. The focal point of the design, analysis, interpretation and publication of research results for each specific phenotype is one of several collaborative phenotype Working Groups (WGs) that have been convened by the CHARGE Research Steering Committee (RSC). One analytic strategy that is being undertaken by many of the CHARGE WGs is to conduct a meta-analysis of GWAS results for single phenotypes common to multiple CHARGE cohorts. The actions of members of CHARGE WGs from each of the individual CHARGE cohorts and other collaborating cohorts should support this research goal. The principles are meant to encourage collaborating investigators to conduct their research in the spirit of collaboration and trust and with transparency regarding potentially sensitive issues about the use of shared data prior to publication.</p>]]>

		<Description>The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epimiology (CHARGE) consortium was formed to facilitate genome-wide association study meta-analyses and replication among large, well-phenotyped cohort studies. CHARGE has incorporated many genomic and phenotypic data from other cohorts, depending on the phenotype. The basic design was estimation of SNP effects on the outcome of airflow obstruction (a key pathophysiologic characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) in 15 population-based cohorts with 32,875 subjects of European ancestry. The discovery meta-analysis was conducted in those with airflow obstruction defined as FEV1 and FEV1/FVC both less than the lower limit of normal, with unaffected  subjects defined as FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC all above the lower limit of normal. Logistic regression models were adjusted for current and former smoking, pack-years of smoking, age, sex, standing height, center/cohort as needed, and principal components for genetic ancestry (as needed). Genome-wide imputation and analysis were performed by cohort investigators, and genome-wide and regional meta-analyses were performed using METAL software. FIve discovery analyses were performed - all cohorts (including ever and never smokers), ever smokers, never smokers, asthma-free participants, and those with FEV1 &#60; 65% predicted (more severe airflow obstruction).</Description>

The discovery GWAS meta-analysis was conducted in 81,925 European ancestry subjects from 30 studies (21 from the AlcGen consortium, 9 from the CHARGE+ consortium). In each cohort, the primary model used the sex-specific residuals of alcohol consumption as a dichotomos trait (heavy vs light/zero) and pooled and used as the main phenotype in subsequent analyses. SNPs were excluded if the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P value was &#60;10<sup>-6</sup> or cohort-specific criteria, minor allele frequency (MAF) was &#60;1%; imputation information score was &#60;0.5; results were only available from two or fewer cohorts; or total n was &#60;10,000. LD score regression was conducted on the GWAS summary results to examine the degree of inflation in test statistics, and genomic control correction was considered unnecessary. Meta-analyses were performed by METAL or R (v3.2.2) with inverse variance-weighted random-effects model  used due to heterogeneity in levels of alcohol consumption and population demographics.

The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epimiology (CHARGE) consortium was formed to facilitate genome-wide association study meta-analyses and replication among large, well-phenotyped cohort studies. CHARGE has incorporated many genomic and phenotypic data from other cohorts, depending on the phenotype. The basic design was estimation of SNP effects on the association between coding-region SNPs (from the Exomechip) with Late-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease (LOAD) in cohorts of European Caucasian ancestry. The discovery meta-analysis was conducted in 1,393 cases and 8,141 cognitively normal controls from 4 studies . The study designs were all population-based cohorts. Analyses used the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) for gene-burden tests. Each study adjusted for age, sex and those principal components associated with LOAD. SKAT tests were performed in R with the seqMeta package in order to meta-analyze study-specific scores and variances/covariances. <p>The data are in the <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000930/analyses/">public ftp site</a>.</p>

The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epimiology (CHARGE) consortium was formed to facilitate genome-wide association study meta-analyses and replication among large, well-phenotyped cohort studies. CHARGE has incorporated many genomic and phenotypic data from other cohorts, depending on the phenotype. The basic design was to conduct genome-wide trans-ethnic meta-analysis of GWAS SNPs associated with variation in erythrocyte traits. Discovery analyses used HapMap-imputed GWAS results that were aggregated from 71,638 subjects in 23 cohorts representing European ancestry (40,258 from the CHARGE consortium), East-Asian ancestry (15,252 from RIKEN and AGEN cohorts), and African-American ancestry (16,128 from the COGENT consortium). Six erythrocyte traits were analyzed as outcome variables: hemoglobin concentration (HB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red blood cell count (RBC). Each cohort analyzed their data to assess association of all SNPs with the six traits. GWAS results of SNPs with MAF&#62;1% were analyzed in ethnic-specific fixed-effects meta-analysis using METAL software with genomic control correction.The three sets of ethnic-specific meta-analytic summary statistics were combined using three approaches: (1) trans-ethnic fixed effect inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis using METAL; (2) summary statistics combined using the MANTRA software that allows for heterogeneity in allelic effects due to differences in LD structure in different ancestry clusters (reported as log10BF); (3) summary statistics analyzed using the Han & Eskin RE2 model, using the METASOFT 3.0c tool. For the six traits, the correlation structure suggested that the number of independent traits was ~4, so the critical P-value for significance was P &#60; 5x10-8/4.0549 = 1.25x10-8. For MANTRA, a log10BF&#62;6.1 was considered as genome-wide significant. <p>The data are in the <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000930/analyses/">public ftp site</a>.</p>
