	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>This study funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) involves conducting a genome-wide association study of common genetic 	variants to identify markers of susceptibility to bladder cancer.</p> 	<p>This bladder GWAS has led to the discovery of three novel regions in the genome associated with bladder cancer risk. Cases were defined 	as individuals having histologically confirmed primary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, including carcinoma in situ (ICD-0-2 topography 	codes C67.0-C67.9 or ICD9 codes 188.1-188.9). Scan data were obtained from two case-control studies carried out in Spain and the 	United States (specifically, those in the Maine and Vermont components of the New England Bladder Cancer Study) and three prospective 	cohort studies in Finland and the United States (specifically Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, Prostate, Lung, 	Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer  Screening Trial, and The American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort).</p> 	<p>We used data from 591,637 single nucleotide polymorphisms 3,532 affected individuals (cases) and 5,119 controls of European descent 	and replication including 8382 cases and 48275 controls from 16 studies. In a combined analysis, we identified three new regions 	associated with bladder cancer on chromosomes 22q13.1, 19q12 and 2q37.1: rs1014971, (P = 8 x 10<sup>-12</sup>) maps to a non-genic region of 	chromosome 22q13.1, rs8102137 (P = 2 x 10<sup>-11</sup>) on maps to CCNE1 and rs11892031 (P = 1 x 10<sup>-7</sup>) maps to the UGT1A cluster 	on 2q37.1. We confirmed four previously identified genome-wide associations on chromosomes 3q28, 4p16.3, 8q24.21 and 8q24.3 	(Rothman N et al., Nature  Genetics, 2010, 	PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20972438" target="_blank">20972438</a>).</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>Bladder cancer is a major public health problem with high disease management costs because of high recurrence of tumors 	requiring frequent screening and interventions (of particular relevant for early stage tumors). There are well-known epidemiologic 	factors that are associated with increased risk for bladder cancer: smoking and occupational exposure to aromatic amines, important 	clues for environmental, medication use, and lifestyle risk factors, as well as fluid balance and urine pH. The portfolio of 	established risk factors should provide opportunities to evaluate risk factors stratified by genotype and genetic factors within 	distinct exposure subgroups. There is also good evidence for a genetic component, given that previous studies have demonstrated 	reproducible associations with NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes. Further, gene-environment interactions have been shown for smoking and 	specific NAT2 genotypes. The modest familial association has not yet been adequately explained but supports the need to search 	for genetic markers associated with bladder cancer. Together these observations provide a strong case for investigation of 	multi-genic associations as well as gene-environment interactions. Excellent information on clinical outcomes including survival 	and tumor recurrence is available for exploration of the influence of genetic variants on these outcomes, which could have 	potentially important clinical implications. Results from a GWAS leading to the identification of genetic makers could provide 	major insights into novel regions that regulate new mechanisms underlying bladder cancer pathogenesis. Findings from the GWAS 	could also provide etiological clues leading to the identification of additional modifiable factors that increase bladder cancer 	risk, recurrence and survival. The potential is great for advancing the understanding of the genetic contribution to bladder cancer, 	which could establish the foundation for developing novel approaches towards prevention while decreasing the burden of bladder 	cancer.</p>]]>
