	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The EVE Asthma Genetics Consortium comprises U.S. investigators who have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma; the main objective is to combine results of individual studies to increase the overall power to identify loci for asthma and asthma-associated traits. The consortium includes investigators at 9 U.S. institutions with GWAS results for &gt;10,000 individuals representing European American, African American, African Caribbean, U.S. Hispanic, and Mexican populations and includes the following studies: <ul> <li>The Study of Asthma Phenotypes and Pharmacogenomic Interactions by Race-Ethnicity (SAPPHIRE)</li> <li>The Genetic Research on Asthma in the African Diaspora (GRAAD) Study</li> <li>The Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans (GALA 1) Study</li> <li>The Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP)</li> <li>The Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network</li> <li>The Children&#39;s Health Study (CHS)</li> <li>Mexico City Childhood Asthma Study (MCCAS)</li> <li>The Chicago Asthma Genetics Study (CAG)*</li> <li>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Collaborative Studies of the Genetics of Asthma (CSGA)*</li> <li>The Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP)*</li> </ul> (*CAG, CSGA, and SARP are part of the NHLBI-supported SNP Typing for Association with Multiple Phenotypes from Existing Epidemiologic Data (STAMPEED) consortium.) </p> <p>For the GWAS, we developed a common set of &gt;1 million genotyped and imputed SNPs from the EVE Asthma Genetics Consortium to be tested for association with asthma and associated phenotypes in all samples and combined p-values for a grand meta-analysis for asthma gene discovery.</p> <p>The broad goals of this project were to characterize the genetic architecture of asthma and associated quantitative phenotypes (e.g., lung function, total serum IgE) in ethnically diverse populations from the U.S., Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Barbados.</p>]]>

<p>The goal of the EVE Consortium, which includes GWAS datasets from nine research groups in the United States, is not only to increase the power to identify SNPs, genes and pathways associated with asthma risk by combining studies but also to provide a better understanding of the patterns of variation in asthma risk genes or variants in the three major ethnic groups in the United States and to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the differences in genetic risk patterns between European-American, African-American and African-Caribbean, and Latino individuals.</p>The results reported here are based on analyses of &#62;2 million SNPs in 3,246 cases with asthma, 3,385 non-asthmatic controls, 1,702 asthma case-parent trios, and 355 family based cases and 468 family-based controls, comprising three ethnic groups: European American, African American and African Caribbean, and Latino. We performed four genome-wide investigations: one meta-analysis in each of three ethnic groups and one in the combined sample.
