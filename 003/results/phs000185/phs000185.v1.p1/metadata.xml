	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>We conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) of disease-associated quantitative phenotypes in the Hutterites, 

	a founder population of European descent. The Hutterites in our studies live on communal farms in South Dakota and are 

	related to each other through multiple lines of descent in a 3,657-person, 13-generation pedigree with 64 founders. 

	The small number of founding genomes reduces genetic heterogeneity whereas their communal lifestyle ensures that 

	non-genetic factors are remarkably uniform between individuals. During our <u>Phase 1 studies</u>, between 1996 and 1997, 

	we measured qualitative and quantitative phenotypes that are associated with common diseases in ~750 individuals 

	living in 9 Hutterite colonies.  These individuals were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500k array. The SNPs included 

	in our GWAS had &gt;90% call rates, minor allele frequencies &gt;5%, Hardy-Weinberg p-values &gt;0.001 (corrected 

	for Hutterite population structure), and fewer than 5 Mendelian errors.  During our Phase 2 studies, 

	between 2006 and 2009, we phenotyped ~900 individuals living in 9 Hutterite colonies (7 overlapping with 

	Phase 1 colonies).  The Phase 2 individuals were genotyped with the Affymetrix 5.0 or 6.0 array. The SNPs included 

	in the GWAS had &gt;95% call rates, minor allele frequencies &gt;5%, Hardy-Weinberg p-values &gt;0.001 (corrected for 

	Hutterite population structure), and fewer than 5 Mendelian errors.  The combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 sample 

	includes 1264 unique individuals; ~ 400 individuals participated in both Phase 1 and 2 studies.  These 1264 

	individuals are the subjects of ongoing and future studies.</p>]]>
