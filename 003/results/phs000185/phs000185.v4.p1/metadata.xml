	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>We have conducted genetic studies of disease-associated quantitative phenotypes, including microbiome and gene expression studies, by genotyping and/or sequencing in the Hutterites, a founder population of European descent. The Hutterites who have participated in our studies live on communal farms in South Dakota and are related to each other through multiple lines of descent in a 3,657-person, 13-generation pedigree with 64 founders. The small number of founding genomes reduces genetic heterogeneity whereas their communal lifestyle ensures that non-genetic factors are remarkably uniform between individuals. Our sample includes &gt;1,600 subjects who have participated in our studies of fertility (since 1982), asthma, cardiovascular disease and other complex phenotypes (since 1993), microbiome studies (since 2011), and/or immune response (since 2012), including <ul> <li>114 subjects with whole genome sequencing</li> <li>139 subjects with 16S sequencing (fecal and nasal)</li> <li>431 subjects with RNA sequencing (lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs))</li> </ul> </p>]]>
	</Description>
	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Individuals living in the Hutterite colonies we visited who were age 6 years and older or 15 years and older were invited to participate in our studies of complex phenotypes and the gut and nasal microbiome; see descriptions of individual studies for details on study-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p>]]>

Ascertainment was population-based and included all individuals ages 6 years and older who were available on the days of our visits to South Dakota. The samples were genotyped using the early access and commercial Affymetrix GeneChip 500k mapping arrays at The University of Chicago.</Description>

		<Description>This genome-wide association study of the reproductive trait, family size, was conducted in 269 married men who are members of a large Hutterite pedigree that proscribes contraception and has large family sizes and are participants in genetic studies of fertility.  Ascertainment was population-based and included Hutterite men with at least one child. The samples were genotyped using one of three Affymetrix SNP arrays: GeneChip GeneChip 500k mapping Array, Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0, or Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 at The University of Chicago.</Description>

		<Description>This genome-wide association study of lymphocyte count was conducted in 462 members of a large Hutterite pedigree, who are participants in genetic studies of complex phenotypes and common diseases at the University of Chicago. Samples were genotyped using Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 500K Array Set.  Lymphocyte counts were obtained as part of a standard differential blood count.  Individuals who reported taking antibiotics at the time were excluded from further study.  Lymphocyte counts were natural logarithm-transformed. And age was included as a covariate in our association test.</Description>
