	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>To learn about the etiology of lung cancer among never-smoking women in Asia, we formed the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia (FLCCA), which includes studies of lung cancer in Eastern Asia and conducted a GWAS. We analyzed a total of 5510 lung cancer cases and 4544 controls and identified 3 novel loci (Lan et al., 2012). Of these study subjects, 4922 lung cancer cases and 3959 controls are available for posting.</p> <p>Lan et al.., Genome-wide association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci in never-smoking women in Asia. Nat Genet. 2012 Dec;44(12):1330-5. doi: 10.1038/ng.2456. Epub 2012 Nov 11. PubMed PMID: 23143601.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Participants (all non-smoking female) were drawn from studies in Eastern Asia. Cases were histologically confirmed lung cancer.</p> <p>Exclusions included: (i) samples with low completion rates; (ii) samples with extreme mean heterozygosity rates. The thresholds were chosen based on the sample completion rates or sample mean heterozygosity distribution by each QC group; and (iii) discordant expected duplicate samples. The average genotype concordance rate for the expected duplicates was great than 99.9%. Further QC at the individual level led to the following exclusions: (i) gender discordance; (ii) subjects with Asian ancestry less than 86%; (iii) subjects with first degree relatives in dataset; (iv) subjects with incomplete phenotype, ever smoked, unknown histology or ineligibility.</p> <p>In addition, data from the GELAC study that was scanned using non-NIH Taiwan resources before Taiwan joined the FLCCA GWAS are not being posted. These data were scanned on the Ilumina 317 and 610. Further, data from 5 subjects from the Singapore study are not being posted, since these subjects indicated on their informed consent that they did not wish their data to be used by any other investigators except those in the Singapore study.</p>]]>
