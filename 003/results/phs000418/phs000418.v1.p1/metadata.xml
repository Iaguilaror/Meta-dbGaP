	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The earliest genetic abnormalities in cancer represent a unique opportunity for timely clinical diagnosis.  Classic deep sequencing of      tumors identifies many aberrations acquired later in cancer progression.  In this study, data regarding simple mutation and chromosomal      aberration were integrated to trace the evolution of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and ovarian adenocarcinomas.  Only after the      second allele of TP53 was lost did the genome enter a window of extreme genomic vulnerability, in both cancer types, eventually acquiring      more than 100,000 mutations in skin cancers.  Inactivating Notch mutations were also identified as prevalent secondary changes.  These      results add context to the idea of TP53 mutation as dominant negative and occurring later in tumorigenesis.</p>]]>

<p>Between the years of 2006 and 2010, one woman and seven men were enrolled in the study of skin cancer.  Their ages ranged from 61 to 87 years.       Informed consent was provided according to UCSF Committee on Human Research guidelines for large-scale genetic analysis.  Data sharing is      allowed so long as identity is not revealed.  Board certified dermatopathologists confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the      skin, from biopsies, for all study samples.  Tissue was isolated using curettage before Mohs micrographic surgery. Control samples were      obtained from adjacent normal skin.</p>]]>
