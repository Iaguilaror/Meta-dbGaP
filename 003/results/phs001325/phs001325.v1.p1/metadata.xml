	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The iPSCORE Resource of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) was created as part of the Next-Gen Consortium funded by the NHLBI. The overarching purpose of the iPSCORE Resource is to provide a large collection of hiPSCs for use in studying the impact of genetic variation on molecular and physiological phenotypes. This Resource is being used in a number of ongoing studies for which genomic data will be generated and deposited into public repositories and linked through dbGaP. A total of 273 individuals have participated in the study for which 222 have had hiPSCs generated from fibroblasts (available through WiCell (<a href="http://www.wicell.org/" target="_blank">http://www.wicell.org/</a>)). Of the 273 individuals, 181 are part of 55 families that include 24 monozygotic twin pairs and 5 dizygotic twin pairs, allowing for the incorporation of familial relationships into genetic analyses. Germline DNA has been sequenced from blood or fibroblast samples for all 273 individuals (this study) and other genomic data (RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and genotype arrays) has been generated from the 222 hiPSCs derived from a subset of these individuals (<a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000924">phs000924</a>). Future studies will include differentiation of these hiPSCs to other cell types, including cardiomyocytes, and the generation of additional genomic data.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>The iPSCORE study had three recruiting approaches: 1) We targeted the recruitment of twins (monozygotic and dizygotic) and their immediate families from a southern California twin registry; 2) We worked with physicians to refer subjects (and their family members) into the study based on a diagnosed cardiovascular disease. In all cases where a physician referred an individual, the clinical diagnosis is provided; 3) Through advertisement on the internet and via fliers, we targeted the recruitment of large families, independent of the presence of twins or individuals with cardiovascular disease.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>Elucidating the functions of regulatory variants is challenging because they often impact cell-specific phenotypes and therefore must be studied in relevant cell types. Projects such as the Roadmap Epigenomics have provided considerable insights into the role of tissue-specific regulatory DNA by identifying chromatin states across a wide number of tissues and cell lines, while <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000424">GTEx</a> has examined how genetic variation affects gene expression, identifying quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across several human tissue types. However, these studies are limited either by the fact that only a few individuals with different genetic backgrounds were examined (Roadmap Epigenomics) or by the ability to obtain sufficient biological material to perform multiple assays on a given sample (<a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000424">GTEx</a>). Therefore, the ability to functionally interrogate genetic variants underlying cell-type specific traits is limited.</p> <p>To overcome this challenge, we have developed the iPSCORE Resource comprising hiPSCs from hundreds of different individuals. We propose to use these hiPSCs to derive a variety of cell types including cardiomyocytes. The derived cell types will then be used as a model system to interrogate the functions of genetic variants associated with cell-type specific molecular and physiological traits. The data to be generated for the iPSC-derived cells will include RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and DNA methylation arrays.</p>]]>
