	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The overall goal of this project is to investigate the etiology and pathogenesis of malformations (i.e., birth defects) of the  	limb, concentrating on abnormalities of limb patterning such as limb deficiency/duplications and multiple congenital contractures.</p>  	<p>The exome sequences of two siblings and two unrelated individuals were obtained by massively parallel DNA sequencing.  	The four individuals were affected with Miller syndrome (OMIM: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/263750">263750</a>).</p>  	<p>Additionally, the whole-genome sequences of a family of four were obtained with the method of Complete Genomics Incorporated (CGI).  	The two offspring were both affected with Miller syndrome and is the same sibling pair mentioned previously from whom exome sequences  	were also obtained.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>Miller syndrome is a very rare disease with a single-gene recessive mode of inheritance.  A hypothesis was made that this gene  	would be identifiable as a gene common to all four individuals with Miller syndrome, wherein each individual had at least  	two novel, protein-changing variants in the gene after filtering against public SNP databases and HapMap exomes.</p>  	<p>For analysis of whole genome data, a hypothesis was made that this gene would be identifiable as a gene shared by two  	siblings in a family with Miller syndrome. The gene should be in an IBD block. The defect in the gene should be detrimental.  	The variation responsible for the defect should be exceptionally rare. The two affected offspring in this family also have  	primary ciliary dyskinesia. Candidate genes identified in this study, consistent with a rare recessive inheritance mode,  	and shared by the two offspring include DHODH, DNAH5, KIAA0556, and CES1. DHODH was subsequently confirmed in additional  	affected individuals as being primarily responsible for Miller syndrome  	(PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&cmd=DetailsSearch&term=19915526">19915526</a>).  	DNAH5 is responsible for primary ciliary dyskinesia (OMIM: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/603335">603335</a>).  	The roles, if any, of KIAA0556 and CES1 in modulating phenotypes in this pedigree are currently unknown.</p>]]>
