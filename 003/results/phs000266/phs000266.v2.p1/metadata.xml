	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The NIH Intramural Skin Microbiome Consortium (NISMC) is a collaboration of investigators with primary expertise 	in genomics, bioinformatics, large-scale DNA sequencing, dermatology, immunology, allergy, infectious disease, and 	clinical microbiology. Atopic dermatitis (AD, "eczema") is a chronic relapsing skin disorder that affects ~15% of 	U.S. children and is associated with $1 billion of medical costs annually. AD is characterized by dry, itchy skin, 	infiltrated with immune cells. Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is ten-fold more common in AD 	patients and is associated with disease flares. We hypothesize that, in addition to S. aureus, AD may also be 	associated with additional novel microbes and/or selective shifts of commensal microbes that are relevant to 	disease progression. The NISMC seeks to define the microbiota that resides in and on the skin and nares of three 	patient groups, all of whom have eczematous lesions and are currently seen at the NIH Clinical Center: (1) AD 	patients; (2) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients; and (3) Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) patients. 	Examination of the microbiome of patients with WAS or HIES syndromes, both rare immunodeficiencies, will 	advance our understanding of how an individual&#39;s immune system shapes their cutaneous microbial community. We 	are performing a prospective longitudinal study that follows these groups of patient thorough the cycles of 	eczema flares, ascertaining clinical data and samples at each stage.</p>]]>

<p><b>Inclusion Criteria for AD/HIES/WAS patients (unless specified otherwise):</b> 		<ol> 			<li>Males or females 3 - 40 years of age.  Minimum age of 3 enriches for patients that have active AD and 			are statistically less likely to resolve during this longitudinal study.  Maximum age of 40 is to reduce 			chance of recruiting patients with age-related changes in skin.</li> 			<li>AD patients: Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis on the basis of the criteria defined by UK Working Party&#39;s 			Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis.  (Reference: Williams HC, Burney PG, Pembroke AC, et al: The U.K. 			Working Party&#39;s Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis. III. Independent hospital validation.

Included in appendix. (Reference: Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index. Consensus Report of the 			European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis.

Subjects who are unable to temporarily discontinue use of 			topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors for &#8805; 7 days to small areas of skin intended for sampling. 			(Topical therapies for AD may be continued to non-adjacent, non-target sites.)</li> 			<li>AD patients: Subjects with underlying immunodeficiency, either as primary disease or secondary to treatment.</li> 			<li>WAS/HIES patients: unable to remain off topical steroids and emollients (skin sampling sites only) for at 			least 24 hours prior to skin sampling. HIES/WAS patients will not be taken off their systemic (oral) antibiotics 			or systemic (oral) steroids. (Topical therapies may be continued to non-adjacent, non-target sites.)</li> 			<li>Subjects who are currently or have previously received treatment with chemotherapy or radiation for treatment 			of malignancies.</li> 			<li>Subject with a chronic disease requiring treatment; e.g. diabetes, bone marrow transplant, hepatitis.</li> 		</ol> 	</p> 	<p><b>Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Volunteers and Age Matched Controls:</b> 		<ol> 			<li>Males or females 3 - 40 years of age.</li> 			<li>Interval visits and age of controls must match enrolled AD patients</li> 		</ol> 	</p> 	<p><b>Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Volunteers and Age Matched Controls:</b> 		<ol> 			<li>Subjects with unstable or uncontrolled medical conditions that could require hospitalization during the 			course of the study or who have been hospitalized in the last month.</li> 			<li>Subjects receiving or planning to receive an IND agent, ultraviolet light therapy, monoclonal antibodies, 			or systemic immunosuppressants &lt; 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is the longer time period) of initiating this protocol.</li> 			<li>Subjects who are unable to remain off systemic (oral) antibiotics or systemic (oral) steroids for at least 7 days.</li> 			<li>Subjects with underlying immunodeficiency, either as primary disease or secondary to treatment.</li> 			<li>Subjects who are currently or have previously received treatment with chemotherapy or radiation.</li> 			<li>Subject with a chronic disease requiring treatment; e.g. diabetes, bone marrow transplant, hepatitis.</li> 			<li>Subject with other documented chronic dermatologic disease, such as AD or psoriasis that may interfere with 			evaluation of cutaneous microbiome.  Common transient conditions, such as acne, are permissible.</li> 			<li>Subjects who work or reside in healthcare facilities or in non-hospital settings that provide healthcare such as 			assisted living facilities, homeless shelters, jails and prisons as well as subjects with frequent exposure to 			laboratory animals, in order to minimize potential ascertainment bias. Certain pathogens such as Staphylococcus 			aureus and multi-drug resistant organisms are disproportionately associated with delivery of healthcare.</li> 		</ol> 	</p>]]>
