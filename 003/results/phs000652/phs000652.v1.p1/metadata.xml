	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>We conducted a new independent GWAS of adult glioma using 1,856 cases and 4,955 controls from 14 cohort studies belonging to the Cohort Consortium, 3 case-control studies, and 1 population-based case only study. Cases were newly diagnosed glioma [ICDO-3 codes 9380-9480 or equivalent], and controls were cancer-free at the time of glioma diagnosis. We found evidence of strong replication for three of the seven previously reported associations at 20q13.33 (RTEL), 5p15.33 (TERT), and 9p21.3 (CDKN2BAS), and consistent association signals for the remaining four at 7p11.2 (EGFR both loci), 8q24.21 (CCDC26) and 11q23.3 (PHLDB1). The direction and magnitude of the signal were consistent for samples from cohort and case-control studies, but the strength of the association was more pronounced for loci rs6010620 (20q,13.33; RTEL) and rs2736100 (5p15.33, TERT) in cohort studies despite the smaller number of cases in this group, likely due to higher grade tumors being captured in the cohort studies. Our findings suggest that larger studies focusing on novel approaches as well as specific tumor subtypes or subgroups will be required to identify additional common susceptibility loci for glioma risk.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>Within the framework of the NCI-sponsored Cohort Consortium, investigators from 16 prospective epidemiologic cohorts agreed to launch a cohort-based genome wide association scan of glioma ("GliomaScan") in collaboration with investigators from three case-control studies and 1 population-based case only study. GliomaScan is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and involves conducting a genome-wide scan of common genetic variants to identify markers of susceptibility to glioma. The study team includes intramural and extramural researchers associated with the NCI cohort consortium and a select number of case control studies. Genotyping was conducted by the NCI Cancer Genomics Research (CGR) Laboratory.</p>]]>

We conducted a new genome wide association scan of glioma (GliomaScan) to validate previously reported risk regions, and to attempt to identify additional novel risk loci.<p>The final participant count for the association analysis was 1,856 cases and 4,955 controls. 559,977 SNPs were available for analysis in one or more studies.  Each participating study obtained informed consent from study participants and approval from its Institutional Review Board (IRB) for this study and obtained IRB certification permitting data sharing in accordance with the NIH Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).</p>
