	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The primary aim of the study is to conduct a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with 	the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure (HF) among participants enrolled in the 	Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline. The secondary aim is to 	conduct genome-wide association study of other phenotypes in CHS.  The study is an ancillary study to CHS.  CHS is a 	population-based cohort study of risk factors for heart disease and stroke among older adults recruited at 4 US sites 	in 1989-1990.  Subjects underwent an extensive baseline examination, and annual follow-up examinations through 1988-1999.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>The four Field Centers of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) are located in Forsyth County, NC; Sacramento County, CA; 	Washington County, MD; and Pittsburgh, PA.  In June 1990, four Field Centers completed the recruitment of 5201 participants.  In 	June 1993, an additional 687 African Americans were recruited using similar methods.  Each community sample was obtained 	from random samples of the Medicare eligibility lists of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).  Eligible to 	participate were persons living in the household of each sampled individual who were: 1) 65 yrs or 	older; 2) non-institutionalized; 3) expected to remain in the area for 3 yrs; and 4) able to give informed consent.  Excluded 	were those wheelchair-bound, receiving hospice care or cancer treatment.  The minority cohort was recruited using 	similar methods.  Participants were eligible whether or not they had clinically apparent cardiovascular disease.</p> 	<p>For the genome-wide association study, an ancillary study of CHS, participants who had clinical cardiovascular disease 	at baseline were excluded.  Clinical cardiovascular disease was defined as any of the following conditions: coronary 	heart disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, valvular heart disease, stroke, and transient 	ischemic attack.  Participants were also excluded if they did have available DNA or did not provide written informed 	consent for genetic studies.  Of the 4056 participants eligible for whole genome scans, 3869 had DNA and their scans 	produced data that passed quality control standards.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>CHS is an NHLBI contract-funded cohort study designed to evaluate risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and 	stroke in older adults.  The main objective is to identify factors related to the onset and course of heart disease 	and stroke.  Subjects were recruited (as above) in 1989-90, and were followed with semi-annual contacts, alternating 	between telephone calls and surveillance clinic visits through 1998-99.  During follow-up, 1990-1999, many baseline 	examination components were repeated, and a few new ones were added.  The CHS clinic exams ended in June 1999.  After 	June 1999, when the clinic exams ended, two phone calls per year to participants identified events and collected 	limited information.</p>]]>

 This analysis of association between genotype and incident myocardial infarction was conducted in the setting of the Cardiovascular Health Study among 3291 participants (2003 women and 1288 men) of primarily self-described European ancestry who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline, consented to use of their DNA for cardiovascular research, and were successfully genotyped on the Illumina 370 CNV platform. Over an average of 12 years of follow-up, 537 participants experienced an incident myocardial infarction.  Genotyping was conducted at General Clinical Research Center&#8217;s Phenotyping/Genotyping Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai using the Illumina 370CNV Genotyping Beadchip.
