	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The BASIC3 (Baylor College of Medicine Advancing Sequencing in Childhood Cancer Care) study is a National Genome Human Research Institute (NHGRI) and National Cancer Institute-funded Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) consortium project that focuses on prospective implementation of clinical whole exome sequencing in the pediatric oncology clinic. The primary study objective are to integrate information from CLIA-certified germline and tumor exome sequencing into the care of newly diagnosed solid tumor patients at Texas Children&#39;s Cancer Center, and to perform parallel evaluation of the impact of tumor and germline exomes on families and physicians.</p> <p>Blood and frozen tumor (if available) samples are collected from children undergoing surgery or biopsy of newly diagnosed solid tumors and subjected to exome sequencing in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Germline and tumor (if applicable) exome sequencing reports are generated and submitted into the electronic health record and returned to each patient/family by their primary oncologist. If specific (optional) consent is obtained, research sequencing studies (including transcriptome sequencing) are performed in addition to the clinical exome sequencing.</p>]]>
	</Description>
	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Study enrollment was offered to all patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors (including central nervous system (CNS) tumors) under the age of 18 years who (1) underwent their initial tumor surgery at Texas Children&#39;s Hospital, (2) planned to have ongoing oncologic treatment at Texas Children&#39;s Cancer Center, and (3) had at least one parent who speaks English or Spanish. Patients diagnosed with benign non-CNS solid tumors, e.g. neurofibroma, or with recurrent tumors who had received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy were excluded.</p>]]>
