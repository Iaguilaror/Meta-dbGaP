	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>PAGE II (2013-2017) seeks to expand understanding gained during PAGE I and similar studies of how ancestry-specific differences in allele frequencies and LD may explain differences in risks of common traits and conditions. Recent studies have identified rare genetic variants that are likely to contribute to common diseases and traits and observed that rare variants likely to be functional, such as those in coding and regulatory regions, tend to be population-specific. PAGE II has genotyped over 50,000 samples using MEGA, an Illumina high density custom exomechip array. The MEGA data is being imputed in PAGE to the 1000 Genomes panel. PAGE also sequenced 1,000 samples representative of 21 populations from the Americas. PAGE has harmonized phenotype data for ~300 trait variables. These datasets will be analyzed to continue emphasis on characterizing population-level disease risks in non-European-descent individuals. Cohorts in PAGE II are: CALiCo (Causal Variants Across the Life Course, a consortium of ARIC, CARDIA, HCHS/SOL, Strong Heart Studies), ISMMS (Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank), MEC (Multiethnic Cohort), WHI (Women&#39;s Health Initiative), and Stanford University (PAGE Global Reference Panel). Genotyping services were provided by the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) and sequence data were provided by the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine.</p> <p>PAGE I (2008-2013): The first phase of PAGE examined putative causal genetic variants across approximately 100,000 African Americans, Asian Americans, American Indians, European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Hawaiians from four groups representing nine large U.S.-based cohorts. Two genotyping approaches were employed - targeted genotyping of selected SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies of common disease, and a large-scale effort focused on the Metabochip array, which facilitated trans-ethnic fine mapping of several diseases of public health importance. Cohorts in PAGE I were: CALiCo (Causal Variants Across the Life Course, a consortium of ARIC, CARDIA, CHS, HCHS/SOL, Strong Heart Cohort Study, Strong Heart Family Study), EAGLE (Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment, based on 3 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)), MEC (Multiethnic Cohort) and WHI (Women&#39;s Health Initiative).</p> <p>Logistical and scientific support is provided by the PAGE Coordinating Center and the NHGRI Division of Genomic Medicine. PAGE II is funded by the NHGRI and the NIMHD.</p> <p>To access PAGE studies currently available in dbGaP, please click on the links below.Please note that some PAGE studies belong to larger cohorts and have been included as PAGE substudies.

		<Description>The Strong Heart Study was established to investigate the prevalence, severity of, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease among American Indians. The Strong Heart Study consists of 1) a cohort population of 4,500 American Indian men and women recruited from centers in three geographic regions: Arizona, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota with 3 clinic visits and ongoing Mortality and Morbidity surveillance (Phase I: 1989-1991; Phase II: 1993-1995; Phase III: 1998-1999, respectively), and 2) a multigenerational family genetic study examined in Phase IV (2001-2003) and Phase V (2005-2008) recruited from the same centers and including 3,838 individuals from 94 families, of whom 825 are Phase III participants re-examined in Phase IV. The data for this analysis were from (2) above from the Arizona recruitment site.</Description>

		<Description>The Women&#39;s Health Initiative (WHI) is a case-cohort founded to address the most common causes of death, disability and impaired quality of life in postmenopausal women. Subjects (n=141,645, age range 50-79) were collected over a 15 year period starting in 1991. Subjects are from primarily five ancestries, European American, African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian. Genotyping was performed at Translational Genomics Research Institute using the Illumina BeadXpress platform.</Description>

This was a meta-analysis of lipid traits including 9 studies with genotyped samples using the Cardio-metabochip and from 2 studies with  imputed.  We analyzed SNPs that fell among the 58 known densely typed lipid regions on the Cardio-metabochip which included approximately 23,000 SNPs. The sample included several studies with individuals of African, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American ancestries.  Taiwanese were included in the meta-analysis of Asian Americans. The lipid traits included LDL cholesterol (mg/dl), HDL cholesterol (mg/dl), and triglycerides (mg/dl).  Lipid medications were accounted for by adding a constant to the lipid phenotype based on the medication type.  Fasting status was available in 9% of samples. All those not fasting for at least 8 hours were removed, those without fasting data were not excluded.  LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation. All studies HDL-C and Triglycerides using Standard enzymatic methods.  The natural log of triglycerides was used for association analyses given the non-normality of this measure.  Covariates included age, sex study center, and PCs 1-10.(Hum Mol Genet. 2016 Dec 15;25(24):5500-5512. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddw358; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28426890">PMID:28426890</a>)
