	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this project is to determine variation in human bitter perception and the effectiveness of bitter blockers in individuals of different genotypes. The project is based on the parent project titled "Efficacy of bitter taste blockers on flavor acceptance in pediatric population", which addresses how bitter taste perception affects medication compliance. As a part of the parent project, mothers and their children were recruited from the general population of metropolitan Philadelphia through print and internet media as well as from a database of past research participants. Adults (mothers) were evaluated in the laboratory for bitter taste perception for a variety of "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) bitter compounds using the general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS) which allows subjects to rate sensory intensity. Mothers were also evaluated for perception of the liquid formulation of the drug Kaletra<sup>TM</sup>, a recommended 1st line treatment for infants with HIV infection, whose taste is rejected by some children and accepted well by others. DNA samples from mothers were genotyped as a part of this study to identify (1) novel genes associated with human bitter perception and (2) the ability of compounds to block bitterness.</p>]]>

		<Description><![CDATA[
84 unrelated women tasted the liquid formulation of Kaletra&#174; and rated its flavor (using the hedonic general Labeled Magnitude Scale which frames affective experience in terms of the strongest imaginable liking (94) to strongest imaginable disliking (-94) of any kind) and provided salivary samples for genotyping (HumanOmni2.5m-8v1-1bead microarray).  A genome-wide association analysis was conducted with PLINK and genotypes were imputed using reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. We found varied, but reliable, individual differences in taste ratings (i.e., ratings ranged from 33 to -87 which was from strong liking to strongest imaginable dislike), which were explained in part by genetic variation from six regions of the genome (chr 1, 5, 10, 13, 14 and 22).
