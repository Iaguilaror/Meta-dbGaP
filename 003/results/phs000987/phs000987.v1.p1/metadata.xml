	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Our goal is to find genetic modifiers of major phenotypes in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome or velo-cardio-facial syndrome. Whole exome sequencing was performed as part of a contract to the NHLBI, Resequencing and Genotyping Service. We have obtained cardiac phenotype information from the de-identified subjects enrolled in the study, either by echocardiography report or medical doctor report. All of the subjects have a 3 million base pair 22q11.2 deletion flanked by low copy repeats, LCR22, A-D.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Inclusion criteria: All individuals have the 3 million base pair 22q11.2 deletion on one allele of chromosome 22. They are all unrelated subjects that have enrolled in the research study with their informed consent and are de-identified for research. They have known cardiac phenotype clinical information. Either gender was included. The subjects are self-reported as Caucasian.</p> <p>Exclusion criteria would be an individual that does not have a 22q11.2 deletion or has unknown cardiac phenotype information.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>The DNA samples from affected individuals have been obtained as part of an international 22q11.2 consortium for which began by forming a collaboration between researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in NYC and Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelpha, PA. The goal is to understand how DNA variants can alter phenotypes in patients with the typical 22q11.2 deletion syndrome with each possessing a 3 million base pair 22q11.2 deletion.</p>]]>
