	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The iPSCORE Resource of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) was created as part of the Next-Gen Consortium funded by the NHLBI. The overarching purpose of the iPSCORE Resource is to provide a large collection of hiPSCs for use in studying the impact of genetic variation on molecular and physiological phenotypes. This Resource is being used in a number of ongoing studies for which genomic data will be generated and deposited into public repositories and linked through dbGaP. A total of 273 individuals have participated in the study for which 222 have had hiPSCs generated from fibroblasts (available through WiCell (<a href="http://www.wicell.org/" target="_blank">http://www.wicell.org/</a>)). Of the 273 individuals, 181 are part of 55 families that include 24 monozygotic twin pairs and 5 dizygotic twin pairs, allowing for the incorporation of familial relationships into genetic analyses. Germline DNA has been sequenced from blood or fibroblast samples for all 273 individuals (see <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs001325">phs001325</a>) and other genomic data (RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and genotype arrays) has been generated from the 222 hiPSCs derived from a subset of these individuals (phs000924). Future studies will include differentiation of these hiPSCs to other cell types, including cardiomyocytes, and the generation of additional genomic data.</p>]]>

<p>The iPSCORE study had three recruiting approaches: 1) We targeted the recruitment of twins (monozygotic and dizygotic) and their immediate families from a southern California twin registry; 2) We worked with physicians to refer subjects (and their family members) into the study based on a diagnosed cardiovascular disease. In all cases where a physician referred an individual, the clinical diagnosis is provided; 3) Through advertisement on the internet and via fliers, we targeted the recruitment of large families, independent of the presence of twins or individuals with cardiovascular disease.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>Elucidating the functions of regulatory variants is challenging because they often impact cell-specific phenotypes and therefore must be studied in relevant cell types. Projects such as the Roadmap Epigenomics have provided considerable insights into the role of tissue-specific regulatory DNA by identifying chromatin states across a wide number of tissues and cell lines, while <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000424">GTEx</a> has examined how genetic variation affects gene expression, identifying quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across several human tissue types. However, these studies are limited either by the fact that only a few individuals with different genetic backgrounds were examined (Roadmap Epigenomics) or by the ability to obtain sufficient biological material to perform multiple assays on a given sample (<a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000424">GTEx</a>). Therefore, the ability to functionally interrogate genetic variants underlying cell-type specific traits is limited.</p> <p>To overcome this challenge, we have developed the iPSCORE Resource comprising hiPSCs from hundreds of different individuals. We propose to use these hiPSCs to derive a variety of cell types including cardiomyocytes. The derived cell types will then be used as a model system to interrogate the functions of genetic variants associated with cell-type specific molecular and physiological traits. The data to be generated for the iPSC-derived cells will include RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and DNA methylation arrays.</p>]]>
