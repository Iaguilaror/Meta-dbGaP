	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> (<i>M. leprae</i>).  Due to <i>M. leprae&#39;s</i>

	narrow host range and an inability to be cultured <i>in vitro</i>, the biological investigation of this disease has been difficult.  Host

	genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in disease development, but few have been identified.</p>

	<p>In this study, we attempted to identify the host genetic factors by performing a two-stage genome-wide association

	study (GWAS) in Chinese population.  The initial genome-wide scan was done by genotyping 706 patients and 1225 controls using

	the Illumina HumanHap610 BeadChip, and the follow-up study was performed by genotyping 93 SNPs in three independent samples

	consisting of 3254 cases and 5955 controls.  We identified significant association (P&lt;10<sup>-10</sup>) within six genes

	CCDC122 (13q14), C13orf31 (13q14), NOD2 (16q12), TNFSF15 (9q32), HLA-DR (6p21) and RIPK2 (8q21), and suggestive

	association (P=5.68x10<sup>-6</sup>) within LRRK2 (12q12).  We also revealed suggestive evidence for C13orf31, LRRK2,

	NOD2 and RIPK2 to show stronger association in the multibacillary form than the paucibacillary form of leprosy. Our

	findings highlight the importance of the innate immune response, particularly NOD2-mediated signaling, in leprosy

	and suggests a new therapeutic target for leprosy.</p>

	<p>Here, the summary statistics from the initial genome-wide association analysis were reported.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>The GWAS sample consisted of 738 persons affected by leprosy and 1276 controls of Chinese Han.  All the subjects were recruited

	from Central China (Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces) in 2005 to 2008. The diagnosis of leprosy was based on medical records

	stored in local leprosy control institutions and clinical assessments at the time of blood taken (looking for evidence of leprosy

	such as claw hand, lagophthalmos or foot drop, etc).  The controls were healthy individuals without leprosy, autoimmune and

	systemic disorders and family history of leprosy (including first-, second- and third-degree relatives).  Demographic characteristics

	were also collected.  All the cases and controls were recruited using the uniform criteria and matched regarding to ethnic origin

	and geographic area.  The ethnicity of all the subjects was determined based on self-reported ancestry.  All the subjects were

	recruited with written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional IRB committees at the Shandong

	Provincial Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, Shandong Academy of Medical Science and the Anhui Medical University.</p>]]>

		<Description><![CDATA[
A GWAS of leprosy was performed by genotyping 738 patients and 1276 controls.  As quality control, 85056 SNPs were removed due to low genotype call rate (&#60;90%), or low minor allele frequency (MAF &#60;1%) in either cases or controls, or showing significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium in the controls (p-value &#8804; 10-7).  In addition, all the intensity-only SNPs and the SNPs on the X, Y and mitochondria chromosomes were also excluded.  After removing 30 samples due to their low call rates (&#60;0.98), we examined potential genetic relatedness among the remaining 724 cases and 1260 controls, leading to the removal of additional 32 controls and 18 cases as &#8242;potential&#8242; familial relatives (up to second-degree relatives).  The remaining 1934 samples (706 cases and 1228 controls) were subsequently assessed for population stratification using a principal component analysis (PCA).  PCA analysis was performed in two steps. First, the analysis was performed by combining the 1934 samples with 206 reference HapMap samples (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) (57), Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT) (44), Chinese Han in Beijing, China (CHB) (45) and CEPH (CEU) (45)). 3 population outliers were identified and removed.  Afterwards, the second PCA analysis was performed on the 1931 samples of GWA study (706 cases, 1225 controls), which suggested some genetic mismatch between the 706 cases and 1225 controls.  To minimize the adverse impact of population stratification, we removed 711 control samples that did not match well with the cases, leaving a matched sample of 706 cases and 514 controls. All the patients and controls were self-reported Han Chinese and recruited from Eastern China. The leprosy cases were diagnosed based on consensus by at least two dermatologists. Clinical subtypes and age at onset of disease were collected from medical records. The controls were healthy individuals without leprosy, autoimmune and systemic disorders and family history of leprosy (including first-, second- and third-degree relatives). Demographic characteristics were collected from both the cases and the controls through questionnaires. All the cases and controls were recruited using uniform criteria and matched regarding to ethnic origin and geographic region of recruitment.
