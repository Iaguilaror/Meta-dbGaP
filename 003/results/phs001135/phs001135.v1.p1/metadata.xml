	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The Starting Treatment with Agonist Replacement Therapy (START) study was a 24-week, open-label, randomized trial of methadone <i>versus</i> Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) for the treatment of opioid dependence. Patients were over the age of 18 and met DSM-IV qualifications for opioid dependence. The primary goal of the study was to determine if either medicine was associated with liver toxicity issues in this vulnerable patient population. Liver enzymes were measured at four time points. Urinalysis for opioids, cocaine, cannabis, benzodiazepines, and methamphetamine were performed on a weekly basis. A flexible dosing scheme was used during which physicians could alter medication dose based on withdrawal symptoms and urinalysis results. Neither medication was found to be associated with liver enzyme levels.</p>]]>

	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Individuals were <i>included</i> if they met DSM-IV-TR criteria for opioid dependence and were at least 18 years of age. Individuals were <i>excluded</i> from the trial for any of the following reasons: cardiomyopathy, liver disease, acute psychosis, blood levels of alanine amino transferase or aspartate amino transferase greater than five times the maximum normal level, or poor venous access.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>The Smokescreen&#174; Genotyping Array by BioRealm&#174; was created with support of a NIDA SBIR contract. The chip consists of an Affymetrix backbone with over 800,000 SNPs. The chip covers 98% of common genetic variation in 1000 nominated addiction genes. The chip contains 296,000 markers from African, East Asian, and European populations giving 66% coverage for people of African Ancestry, 82% for people of East Asian Ancestry, and 91 % for people of European ancestry. In addition, 20,000 markers from expert nominations for genes posited to be associated with substance abuse and co-morbid disorders are also included on the chip. In addition, included in the array are more than 11,000 markers in the nicotine acetylcholine receptor gene clusters and nicotine metabolizing genes. There are greater than 16,000 markers for related co-morbidities and diseases. The samples will be released separately by contributing investigators, with ultimately a total of approximately 50,000 targeted. </p>]]>
