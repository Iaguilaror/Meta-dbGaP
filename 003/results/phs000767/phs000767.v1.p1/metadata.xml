	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The UC San Diego Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Study is designed to identify genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes important for CLL. This data release consists of samples collected to 1) identify genomic changes associated with CLL progression using serially collected tumor samples; 2) characterize the transcriptional consequences of SF3B1 mutation through RNA-seq; and 3) characterize the expression profiles of ROR1+ vs. ROR1- tumors. The samples were collected from participants at the University of California, San Diego Moores Cancer Center and the data was generated at UC San Diego or in collaboration with the BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre.</p>]]>
	</Description>
	<StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p>Patient samples were chosen from patients treated at University of California, San Diego from the CLL Research Consortium. Patients in the progression study (1) were required to have an available tumor sample with about 1 yr of diagnosis and 1 yr prior to treatment. At least one of the tumor samples was required to be 80% tumor cells, as evidenced by the % of the cells that were cd5+/cd19+. Samples in the SF3B1 study (2) were selected for the presence of a mutation in SF3B1, as detected by targeted sequencing. Controls for this study overlap with those in the progression study. Samples in the ROR1 study (3) were selected based on their surface expression of ROR1, as assayed by FACS. Samples were considered ROR1- if they expressed ROR1 on &lt;20% of their cells. ROR1+ samples overlap with those in the progression study.</p>]]>
