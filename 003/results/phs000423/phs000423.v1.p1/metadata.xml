	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>ADVANCE (Atherosclerotic Disease, VAscular functioN, and genetiC Epidemiology) is a large epidemiological study of genetic and non-genetic      determinants of coronary artery disease (CAD) that started in 2000 as a collaborative effort between researchers at Stanford University and      Kaiser Permanente of Northern California. The overarching goal of the study is to improve our ability to prevent, diagnose and treat CAD.      The initial study included recruitment of over 3600 subjects (including 1873 subjects with incident clinically significant coronary disease      and 1745 control subjects) from multiple race/ethnic backgrounds.  A subset of ~ 500 subjects with very early onset coronary disease      (men &lt; 45 and women &lt; 55) and ~ 500 similar aged controls were genotyped using the Illumina 550K platform as part of an NIH funded      effort within the STAMPEED consortium.</p>]]>

	<StudyHistory><![CDATA[
<p>With the primary aim of uncovering novel genetic determinants of CAD and of acute myocardial infarction (MI), investigators at      Stanford University and Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC) initiated the ADVANCE study in October 2000. Cases and controls      were identified from over 2.9 million enrollees in KPNC, an ethnically diverse population representative of the local and statewide population.      Eligible subjects were identified using the KPNC electronic databases and those who agreed to participate were interviewed and examined at one      of several clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area. To allow for several pre-specified contrasts, a specialized recruitment strategy was devised.      Between October 28, 2001 and December 31, 2003, we assembled a study including over 3,600 subjects with detailed clinical information and blood      for DNA and protein studies.</p>     <p><b>ADVANCE Phase I</b></p>     <p>At the time of the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/advance/phase1/" target="_blank">ADVANCE Phase I study</a>, there were technological      limitations that made it impossible to survey the entire human genome for genetic polymorphisms that are associated with coronary disease.      Thus, initially our approach focused on a more limited candidate gene based approach. We selected candidate genes on the basis of results of      local genomic experiments and an extensive review of the literature. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in each of the      candidate gene loci through a process of SNP discovery, and a subset of these SNPs were genotyped in all participants in the ADVANCE Study      to compare case and control groups with the respect to the acquisition or progression of atherosclerotic disease.</p>     <p>Details regarding the candidate genes, SNPs and genotyping strategy studied in ADVANCE Phase I are available through the ADVANCE web site.      The first phase of ADVANCE was funded through a generous grant from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, Las Vegas from October 2000 until      June 2006.     </p>     <p><b>ADVANCE Phase II</b></p>     <p>In ADVANCE Phase II, we performed a high density GWA scan using over 550,000 SNPs on a population of highly selected and characterized      cohort of young individuals with premature CAD from ADVANCE. This phase of ADVANCE is largely being funded by a grant from the NHLBI that      will ran from October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2009 as part of the STAMPEED effort.</p>     <p>GWA data from the ADVANCE project has been used as part of several large meta-analyses including consortia concerned with coronary      disease (CARDIOGRAM) and anthropomorphic traits (GIANT).  Through dbGaP, analysis data is available.  Individual      level genotypic and phenotypic data can be requested through an ancillary study proposal by contacting the ADVANCE Principal Investigator,      Dr. Thomas Quertermous at <a href="mailto:tomq1@stanford.edu">tomq1@stanford.edu</a>.</p>]]>
