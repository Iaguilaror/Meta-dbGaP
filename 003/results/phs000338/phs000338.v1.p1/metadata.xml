	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Sardinia is the second largest island in the Mediterranean and constitutes a genetically isolated founder population. 	This population has aided in the identification of genes involved in several Mendelian disorders and is attractive for 	genetic studies due to its organization in long-established settlements that developed from an initial group of founder 	settlers (~1,000) thousands of years ago. The current study has recruited 6,148 Sardinians aged 14 and older, from a 	cluster of four towns in the Lanusei Valley in the Ogliastra region of the province of Nuoro. This sample corresponds 	to approximately 62% of the population eligible in the area for recruitment. Information collected during enrollment 	allowed the individuals to be organized into 711 complex pedigrees, each up to five generations deep, with an average 	kinship coefficient of 0.1628. All volunteers have been characterized for 98 quantitative traits. Traits include 	anthropomorphic measures, plasma and serum markers (including cholesterol and other markers of cardiovascular disease), 	and personality traits (using the five-factor model).</p> 	<p>The main goal of the study is to examine phenotypic similarities between relatives that yield information on the 	overall contributions of genes to trait variability.  Data given here provide p-values for 98 traits studied 	in 1,412 individuals, based on genotyping with the Affymetrix 500K chip and imputed markers using the HapMap 	population as a reference (N=2,259,179).  Sharing this genome assessment data at high level of resolution for a variety 	of quantitative traits will be useful for other groups to validate newly observed associations and to investigate possible 	pleiotropic effects.</p> 	<p>For ulterior information, and in particular for any individual genotype information, a formal request should be 	addressed to the Steering Committee, c/o David Schlessinger, Chief, Laboratory of Genetics, National Institute on Aging, 	National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Blvd., Suite 100 Baltimore, MD 21224 USA 	and should include IRB approval of a detailed proposal, along with a signed statement guaranteeing that no attempt 	will be made to identify any individual participant.</p>]]>

<p>Participant ages were 14 years and older.  Among the 1,412 individuals included in this project, there were 659 males 	and 753 females.  All analyses were conducted using age, age squared and sex as covariates, and traits were transformed 	using quantile normalization.</p>]]>

		<Description>We recruited a cohort of 6,148 participants, aged 14-102 y, from four clustered towns in Sardinia. The cohort includes 34,469 relative pairs. To extract genetic information, we implemented software for variance components heritability analysis, designed to handle large pedigrees, analyze multiple traits simultaneously, and model heterogeneity. Here, we report heritability analyses for 98 quantitative traits, in 1500 individuals, based on genotyping with an Affymetrix 500K SNP array platform, focusing on facets of personality and cardiovascular function. The association results presented are from Sardinia genome wide association analysis of body mass index. The sample size is 1410 (658 males and 752 females) and covariates are age, age square and sex.</Description>

		<Description>We recruited a cohort of 6,148 participants, aged 14-102 y, from four clustered towns in Sardinia. The cohort includes 34,469 relative pairs. To extract genetic information, we implemented software for variance components heritability analysis, designed to handle large pedigrees, analyze multiple traits simultaneously, and model heterogeneity. Here, we report heritability analyses for 98 quantitative traits, in 1500 individuals, based on genotyping with an Affymetrix 500K SNP array platform, focusing on facets of personality and cardiovascular function. The association results presented are from Sardinia genome wide association analysis of acceleration time.

		<Description>We recruited a cohort of 6,148 participants, aged 14-102 y, from four clustered towns in Sardinia. The cohort includes 34,469 relative pairs. To extract genetic information, we implemented software for variance components heritability analysis, designed to handle large pedigrees, analyze multiple traits simultaneously, and model heterogeneity. Here, we report heritability analyses for 98 quantitative traits, in 1500 individuals, based on genotyping with an Affymetrix 500K SNP array platform, focusing on facets of personality and cardiovascular function. The association results presented are from Sardinia genome wide association analysis of neutrophils (%). The sample size is 1396 (653 males and 743 females) and covariates are age, age square and sex.</Description>

		<Description>We recruited a cohort of 6,148 participants, aged 14-102 y, from four clustered towns in Sardinia. The cohort includes 34,469 relative pairs. To extract genetic information, we implemented software for variance components heritability analysis, designed to handle large pedigrees, analyze multiple traits simultaneously, and model heterogeneity. Here, we report heritability analyses for 98 quantitative traits, in 1500 individuals, based on genotyping with an Affymetrix 500K SNP array platform, focusing on facets of personality and cardiovascular function. The association results presented are from Sardinia genome wide association analysis of trait from NEO Personality Inventory - Revised: straightforwardness. The sample size is 1277 (583 males and 694 females) and covariates are age, age square and sex.</Description>
