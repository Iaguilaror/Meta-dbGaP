	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is a multi-center epidemiologic study in Hispanic/Latino populations to determine the role of acculturation in the prevalence and development of disease, and to identify risk factors playing a protective or harmful role in Hispanics/Latinos. The study is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and six other institutes, centers, and offices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p> <p>The goals of the HCHS/SOL include studying the prevalence and development of disease in Hispanics/Latinos, including the role of acculturation, and identifying disease risk factors that play protective or harmful roles in Hispanics/Latinos. A total of 16,415 persons of Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American, and South American backgrounds were recruited through four Field Centers affiliated with San Diego State University, Northwestern University in Chicago, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx area of New York, and the University of Miami. Seven additional academic centers serve as scientific and logistical support centers.</p> <p>Study participants aged 18-74 years took part in an extensive clinic exam and assessments to ascertain socio-demographic, cultural, environmental and biomedical characteristics. Annual follow-up interviews are conducted to determine a range of health outcomes.</p> <p><b>The HCHS SOL Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.</b> To view genotypes, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these sub-studies, please click on the following sub-studies below or in the "Sub-studies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page <a href="study.cgi?study_id=phs000810">phs000810</a> HCHS SOL Cohort. <ul> <li><a href="study.cgi?study_id=phs000555">phs000555</a> PAGE CALiCo SOL</li> <li><a href="study.cgi?study_id=phs000880">phs000880</a> HCHS/SOL Omics in Latinos (Ola)</li> </ul> </p>]]>

        <UseLimitation>Use of this data is limited to health/medical/biomedical purposes, does not include the study of population origins or ancestry.
Use of the data is limited to not-for-profit organizations.
All research must be related to the purpose of the study, which is to learn about the health of Hispanic/Latinos in the United States and to identify causes of disease of the Hispanic/Latino populations. The HCHS/SOL dbGaP data is intended to promote the discovery of specific genetic loci acting as risk (or protective) factors for health-related traits.  Use of these data to conduct non-genetic research is prohibited. The data may not be used to investigate individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying study participants.  Investigation of relatedness among individuals, and of genomic composition in terms of genetic ancestry, may be used as tools to detect and characterize genetic risk factors for health-related traits.  However, publications based on HCHS/SOL data may not provide specific pedigree structures, results concerning sensitive issues such as non-paternity, or in any way compromise the anonymity of study participants (either directly or indirectly).  Publication of genetic associations with traits should focus on specific genetic variants rather than overall genetic ancestry profiles.  Publications may not report results that could be considered as stigmatizing to an individual or group.  Data use must be consistent with the HCHS/SOL informed consent, which is limited to the following two groups: a) Health/Medical/Biomedical (HMB) and b) Health/Medical/Biomedical Non-Profit Use Only (HMB-NPU). The NHLBI will keep all Data Use Certifications, and all approved studies utilizing HCHS/SOL dbGaP data will be listed on the dbGaP website.</UseLimitation>
