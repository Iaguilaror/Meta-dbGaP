	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe debilitating hematological disorder associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. There are approximately 200,000 babies born with sickle cell disease each year, with the disease predominately affecting individuals in Africa. The overall global burden of the disease is tremendous, with more than 100,000 patients currently in the US and further millions worldwide. The governing bodies of the World Health Organization have recently adopted a resolution to strengthen the response to sickle disease in all affected countries and there is a definite need for high quality sickle cell disease research that has the potential to improve the treatment and prognosis of patients with this devastating disease. The clinical manifestations of SCD arise from a complex pathophysiology that includes hemolysis, acute vaso-occlusion, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and chronic organ damage. While the individual clinical course of this disease is highly variable, many of the associated complications demonstrate some degree of heritability. Intensive research into identifying genetic modifiers that can affect the pathophysiology of SCD has been limited to date and there is an urgent need to improve of our knowledge the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical complications of SCD. The Sickle cell CIP project is investigating complication of stroke and pharmacogenomics of hydroxyurea response in patients with sickle cell anemia. The major benefit of hydroxyurea comes from its ability to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and higher HbF levels are associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in SCA patients. We will perform whole exome and whole genome sequencing of SCA patients in order to identify genome variants associated with incidences of stroke and HbF response to hydroxyurea.</p>]]>
